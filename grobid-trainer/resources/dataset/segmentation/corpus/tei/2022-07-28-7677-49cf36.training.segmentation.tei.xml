			<body>CORAM: <lb/>HON&apos;BLE MR. JUSTICE C. HARI SHANKAR <lb/>J U D G M E N T <lb/>% <lb/>07.07.2021 <lb/>1. <lb/>This judgment disposes of IA 15352/2019 in CS(Comm) <lb/>611/2019 and IA 2084/2021 in CS(Comm) 69/2021. The captioned <lb/>application has, in each case, been filed by the common plaintiff FMC <lb/>Corporation (who would be referred to, in this judgment, as &quot;the <lb/>plaintiff&quot;), against the defendant Natco Pharma Ltd in CS(Comm) <lb/>611/2019 and against the defendant Best Crop Science LLP in CS <lb/>(Comm)69/2021, under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the Code of <lb/>Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC). <lb/>2. <lb/>In each case, the plaintiff asserts its product patent IN 201307 <lb/>(&quot;IN&apos;307&quot;, in short) and its process patent IN 213332 (&quot;IN&apos;332&quot;, in <lb/>short), which relate to the product Chlorantraniliprole (also known as <lb/>&quot;CTPR&quot;) and the process for the preparation thereof. The plaintiff <lb/>alleges that the defendants are proposing to infringe the suit patents by <lb/>manufacturing and releasing, in the market, their own CTPR products, <lb/>even while the suit patents continue to be alive and without obtaining <lb/>any license from the plaintiff. Injunction, against the defendants from <lb/>doing so has, therefore, been sought in the plaints. <lb/></body>

The defendant does not dispute <lb/>this position. The plaintiff claims that the 3-substituted-2-<lb/>pyridyl ring, with two substituents on the phenyl ring, results in <lb/>compounds with superior insecticidal activity. This superior <lb/>insecticidal activity is also explained under the head &quot;Biological <lb/>Examples of the Invention&quot;, in the suit patent. The plaint <lb/>asserts that the compounds disclosed in the suit patent IN&apos;307 <lb/>are first of a kind, novel anthranilic diamide insecticides which <lb/>are ryanodine receptor activators. CTPR, it is asserted, <lb/>activates the ryanodine receptor in the pest by stimulating the <lb/>release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of its <lb/>muscle cells, resulting in impaired regulation, paralysis and <lb/></body>

			<body>death. The superior and selective action of these insecticides <lb/>against the ryanodine receptor in pests also results in low <lb/>mammalian toxicity. <lb/>(v) IN&apos;307 is a subsisting patent, the life of which would <lb/>expire on 13 th August, 2022 (reckoning 20 years from 13 th <lb/>August, 2002, when the patent was granted). No pre-grant or <lb/>post-grant opposition, to the suit patent, was filed by anyone, <lb/>including the defendant. <lb/>The plaint also asserts that <lb/>counterparts of the suit patent had been granted in more than 40 <lb/>countries, in all of which they continue to subsist till date, <lb/>Colombia being the sole jurisdiction where the equivalent of the <lb/>suit patent was invalidated. <lb/>(vi) IN&apos;332, which was the process patent, was filed on 8 th <lb/>January, 2004, published on 15 th December, 2006 and granted <lb/>on 27 th December, 2007. Priority dates were claimed, in respect <lb/>of the claims in IN&apos;332 as 13 th August, 2001, 21 st September, <lb/>2001 and 2 nd April, 2002, on the basis of US 919, US 128 and <lb/>US 661 respectively. The title of the patent was &quot;A process for <lb/>preparing a compound of Formula 1&quot;. It is not in dispute that <lb/>the process for making CTPR is covered by IN&apos;332. The <lb/>plaintiff asserts that Claim 1 in IN&apos;332 discloses the process for <lb/>preparation of CTPR, whereas Claims 2 to 22 disclose the <lb/>processual steps for arriving at the reactants used in Claim 1. <lb/></body>

			<body>IN&apos;332 would remain alive till 13 th August, 2022, reckoning 20 <lb/>years from 13 th August, 2002. <lb/>(vii) No pre-grant or post-grant opposition was filed in <lb/>relation to IN&apos;332. Moreover, the counterparts of IN&apos;332 had <lb/>been granted patents in over 40 countries, in none of which <lb/>have they been revoked or invalidated. <lb/>(viii) Having thus set out the specifics of the suit patents <lb/>IN&apos;307 and IN&apos;332, the plaint adverts to IN 204978 (&quot;IN&apos;978&quot; <lb/>in short) which, fundamentally, forms the focus of controversy <lb/>in the present case. IN&apos;978 contains a Markush formula, from <lb/>which the compounds in Formula 1 of IN&apos;307 are asserted to be <lb/>a novel and inventive selection. The plaint acknowledges that <lb/>CTPR falls within the scope of the numerous compounds, and <lb/>is in the class of anthranilamides, included in the Markush <lb/>formula, disclosed and claimed in the patent IN&apos;978, but <lb/>asserts, with equal emphasis, that CTPR is not specifically <lb/>disclosed in IN&apos;978 and that no person skilled in the art would <lb/>be able to synthesise CTPR based on the claim and disclosure <lb/>in IN&apos;978. <lb/>(ix) Reliance is placed, in the plaint, on the declaration filed <lb/>with the U.S. Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO), during <lb/>the prosecution of US&apos;836, the counterpart in the US of IN&apos;307. <lb/>The declaration refers to tests conducted, to compare the <lb/>compounds claimed and disclosed in IN&apos;307, with their closest <lb/></body>

			<body>counterparts disclosed in IN&apos;978. These tests indicated superior <lb/>insecticidal activity of the compounds disclosed in IN&apos;307 vis-<lb/>à-vis their closest counterparts disclosed in IN&apos;978. <lb/>(x) As such, the plaint asserts that a person skilled in the art <lb/>would not arrive at CTPR from Formula 22 in IN&apos;978 without <lb/>human intervention and ingenuity and application of hindsight <lb/>knowledge. <lb/>(xi) IN&apos;307 stands worked in India, as CTPR is duly <lb/>registered with the Central Insecticide Board under Section 9(3) <lb/>of the Insecticides Act, 1968 6 , for (i) &quot;Chlorantraniliprole <lb/>technical for import, (ii) Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 % w/w SC for <lb/>indigenous manufacture which is marketed by the plaintiff <lb/>under <lb/>the <lb/>brand <lb/>name <lb/>CORAGEN®, <lb/>and <lb/>(iii) <lb/>Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR for indigenous manufacture which <lb/>is marketed by the plaintiff under the brand name <lb/>6 &quot;9. <lb/>Registration of insecticides: <lb/>***** <lb/>(3) <lb/>On receipt of any such application for the registration of an insecticide, the <lb/>Committee may, after such enquiry as it deems fit and after satisfying itself that the <lb/>insecticide to which the application relates conforms to the claims made by the importer <lb/>or by the manufacturer, as the case may be, as regards the efficacy of the insecticide and <lb/>its safety to human beings and animals, register [on such conditions as may be specified <lb/>by it] and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed, the insecticide, allot a <lb/>registration number thereto and issue a certificate of registration in token thereof within a <lb/>period of twelve months from the date of receipt of the application: <lb/>Provided that the Committee may, if it is unable within the said period to arrive at a <lb/>decision on the basis of the materials placed before it, extend the period by a further <lb/>period not exceeding six months: <lb/>Provided further that if the Committee is of opinion that the precautions claimed by the applicant as <lb/>being sufficient to ensure safety to human beings or animals are not such as can be easily observed <lb/>or that notwithstanding the observance of such precautions the use of the insecticide involves <lb/>serious risk to human beings or animals, it may refuse to register the insecticide.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>FERTERRA®.&quot; The application of the plaintiff for substituting <lb/>M/s FMC India Pvt. Ltd., the affiliate company of Plaintiff No. <lb/>1 in India, as the current registrant of these insecticides, stands <lb/>approved by the Central Insecticides Board and Registration <lb/>Committee on 4 th October, 2019. <lb/>(xii) As such, the plaintiff claims the exclusive rights to <lb/>manufacture, use, market or sell CTPR in India. No third party <lb/>can manufacture, sell or distribute CTPR in India without a <lb/>valid license from the plaintiff. <lb/>(xiii) In October 2019, the plaintiff claims to have learnt of the <lb/>imminent launch, by the defendant, of a CTPR product, which <lb/>would infringe the suit patents IN&apos;307 and IN&apos;332. An <lb/>application for &quot;improved process for the preparation of <lb/>anthranilimide derivatives&quot; has also been filed by the defendant <lb/>before the Indian Patent Office. This application allegedly <lb/>provides for an improved process for preparation of CTPR. Any <lb/>manufacture of CTPR, by such allegedly novel process would <lb/>result in infringement of IN&apos;307, which, as already noted <lb/>hereinbefore, specifically claims CTPR in Claim 8. <lb/>(xiv) The plaint also adverts to a suit filed by the defendant <lb/>under Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963, before the <lb/>City Civil Court, Hyderabad, (&quot;the Hyderabad suit&quot; in short). It <lb/>is asserted, in the plaint, that the said suit is an abuse of process <lb/>of law and is jurisdictionally incompetent. <lb/></body>

In light of the foregoing, it is most humbly prayed that <lb/>the following interim reliefs may be granted by this Hon&apos;ble <lb/>Court <lb/>(i) <lb/>An order of ex parte ad interim injunction <lb/>restraining all the Defendant, its directors, employees, <lb/>officers, servants, agents and all others acting for and <lb/>on their behalf from manufacturing, using, selling, <lb/>distributing, advertising, exporting, offering for sale, <lb/>and in any other manner, directly or indirectly, dealing <lb/>in any product that infringes the claimed subject matter <lb/>of the Plaintiff&apos;s Indian Patent No 201307, including <lb/>the product CHLORANTRANILIPROLE; <lb/>(ii) <lb/>An order of ex parte ad interim injunction <lb/>restraining Defendant, its directors, employees, <lb/>officers, servants, agents and all others acting for and <lb/>on their behalf from using, directly or indirectly, any of <lb/>the processes claimed under Indian Patent No. 213332; <lb/>and <lb/>(iii) Any other Order(s) as this Hon&apos;ble Court may <lb/>deem fit and proper in the facts and circumstances of <lb/>the case.&quot; <lb/>Rival Stands <lb/>7. <lb/>A detailed written statement has been filed by the defendant. <lb/>Arguments, in this matter, continued over several days, with the <lb/>plaintiff initially being represented by Mr. Pravin Anand and, later, by <lb/></body>

			<body>Mr. Sandeep Sethi, learned Senior Counsel, instructed by Mr. Sanjay <lb/>Kumar. Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned Counsel, addressed arguments on <lb/>behalf of the defendant. <lb/>(i) <lb/>Copious written submissions running into several pages, <lb/>with accompanying charts and other materials have been filed. <lb/>They are so exhaustive, and cover the arguments advanced at <lb/>the Bar by the learned Counsel so comprehensively, that it is <lb/>not necessary to refer to the contents of the written statement or <lb/>replication. <lb/>(ii) Given the nature of the controversy, it would be <lb/>appropriate to set out, seriatim, each of the grounds on which <lb/>the defendant contests the suit and the response of the plaintiff <lb/>thereto, side by side. This is because the entire case of the <lb/>defendant is premised on Section 107(1) of the Patents Act 7 , <lb/>which permits the raising, in defence to an allegation of patent <lb/>infringement, of every ground on the basis of which the <lb/>plaintiff&apos;s suit patent may be revoked. As such, the case of the <lb/>defendant is not that it does not propose to launch CTPR <lb/>products in India, as would infringe IN&apos;307 but, rather, that <lb/>IN&apos;307 is itself an invalid patent, and is liable to be revoked. <lb/>(iii) <lb/>Patent rights are, classically, statutory and territorial in <lb/>nature.

			<body>from common law, the right to grant of patent, as well as the <lb/>rights to have an infringing patent revoked, must emanate from <lb/>the Patents Act. Section 64 of the Patents Act provides for the <lb/>grounds on which a patent may be revoked. Of the various <lb/>grounds enumerated therein, those which the defendant, in the <lb/>present case, seeks to invoke, may, for ready reference, be <lb/>reproduced as under: <lb/>&quot;64. Revocation of patents -<lb/>(1) <lb/>Subject to the provisions contained in <lb/>this Act, a patent, whether granted before or <lb/>after the commencement of this Act, may, be <lb/>revoked on a petition of any person interested or <lb/>of the Central Government by the Appellate <lb/>Board or on a counter-claim in a suit for <lb/>infringement of the patent by the High Court on <lb/>any of the following grounds, that is to say -<lb/>(a) <lb/>that the invention, so far as <lb/>claimed in any claim of the complete <lb/>specification, was claimed in a valid <lb/>claim of the earlier priority date <lb/>contained in the complete specification <lb/>of another patent granted in India; <lb/>***** <lb/>(d) <lb/>that the subject of any claim of the <lb/>complete specification is not an <lb/>invention within the meaning of this Act; <lb/>(e) <lb/>that the invention so far as <lb/>claimed in any claim of the complete <lb/>specification is not new, having regard to <lb/>what was publicly known or publicly <lb/>used in India before the priority date of <lb/>the claim or to what was published in <lb/></body>

			<body>India or elsewhere in any of the <lb/>documents referred to in section 13: <lb/>(f) <lb/>that the invention so far as <lb/>claimed in any claim of the complete <lb/>specification is obvious or does not <lb/>involve any inventive step, having regard <lb/>to what was publicly known or publicly <lb/>used in India or what was published in <lb/>India or elsewhere before the priority <lb/>date of the claim; <lb/>***** <lb/>(k) <lb/>that the subject of any claim of the <lb/>complete specification is not patentable <lb/>under this Act;&quot; <lb/>(iv) In this context, Mr. Sai Deepak has also emphasized the <lb/>position that the defendant, in order to succeed in a defence <lb/>against the challenge of infringement, is only required to put up <lb/>a credible challenge, which would suffice to show that the suit <lb/>patent is vulnerable. The moment a credible challenge, which <lb/>discloses vulnerability of the suit patent to revocation is made <lb/>out by the defendant, Mr. Sai Deepak would contend, the <lb/>plaintiffs&apos; case for an interlocutory injunction has necessarily to <lb/>fail. In this context, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on the judgment of a <lb/>Division Bench of this Court in F. Hoffman-La Roche v. <lb/>Cipla 8 . <lb/>(v) Learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff, fairly, does not <lb/>dispute the position, in law, that if the defendant is able to make <lb/>8 2009 (110) DRJ 452 (DB) <lb/></body>

			<body>out a credible case of vulnerability of the suit patent to <lb/>revocation, no interlocutory injunction, against infringement <lb/>(or, more properly, exploitation) of the suit patent, can be <lb/>granted. <lb/>(vi) Given the fact that the defendant does not dispute its <lb/>intent to manufacture and market CTPR, and essentially seeks <lb/>to assail the validity of the suit patent IN&apos;307, it would be <lb/>appropriate to examine, seriatim, the contentions of the <lb/>defendant, vis-à-vis the response of the plaintiff thereto. <lb/>8. <lb/>Non-assertion, by the plaintiff, of IN&apos;978: <lb/>8.1 Mr. Sai Deepak has emphasised the fact that the plaintiff has <lb/>not chosen to assert IN&apos;978, or any Claim therein including Claim 22. <lb/>Mr. Sethi, learned Senior Counsel for the plaintiff, on the other hand, <lb/>is categorical that his client is not asserting IN&apos;978 in the present <lb/>proceedings, which are limited to asserting IN&apos;307 and IN&apos;332. <lb/>8.2 To my mind, this is essentially a non-issue. It is for the plaintiff <lb/>to decide what it chooses to assert. The plaintiff has asserted IN&apos;307 <lb/>and IN&apos;332, and the task of this Court is to examine the merits of the <lb/>said assertion. That the plaintiff has not chosen to assert, in these <lb/>proceedings, IN&apos;978, quite obviously cannot amount to any kind of an <lb/>acknowledgement, on the plaintiff&apos;s part, regarding the vulnerability <lb/>of IN&apos;978 to challenge or revocation -which is why I regard this as a <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 17 of 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>non-issue in the present proceedings. According to the plaintiff, <lb/>IN&apos;978 neither claims, nor discloses, CTPR and does not, therefore, in <lb/>any manner invalidate IN&apos;307 or any of the claims therein including <lb/>Claim 1. In view of this stand, no occasion, obviously, arose for the <lb/>plaintiff to assert IN&apos;978. <lb/>8.3 Nothing, therefore, turns, in my opinion, on the fact that the <lb/>plaintiff has not asserted IN&apos;978 in the present proceedings. Nor can <lb/>this fact assist the case of the defendant. It would be for the defendant <lb/>to establish, independently, that IN&apos;307 is vulnerable, whether on the <lb/>ground of IN&apos;978 or on any other ground. <lb/>9. <lb/>Presumptive validity of a granted patent -Section 13(4) <lb/>9.1 Mr. Sai Deepak submits, relying on Section 13(4) of the Patents <lb/>Act 9 , that the statutory dispensation as it obtains in this country with <lb/>respect to patents does not envisage any presumptive validity of a <lb/>patent, on it being granted. He relies, for the purpose, on Bishwanath <lb/>Prasad Radhey Shyam v. Hindustan Metal Industries 10 . Mr. Sai <lb/>Deepak, in fact, carries the argument to the point of submitting that <lb/>any decision, of this Court or any other Court, which presumes a <lb/>9 &quot;13. <lb/>Search for anticipation by previous publication and by prior claim -<lb/>***** <lb/>(4) <lb/>The examination and investigations required under section 12 and this section <lb/>shall not be deemed in any way to warrant the validity of any patent, and no liability shall <lb/>be incurred by the Central Government or any officer thereof by reason of, or in <lb/>connection with, any such examination or investigation or any report or other proceedings <lb/>consequent thereon.&quot; <lb/>10 (1979) 2 SCC 511 <lb/></body>

			<body>patent to be valid because it has been granted, is per incuriam, in view <lb/>of para 32 of Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam 10 . <lb/>9.2 Disregarding of judicial precedents on the ground that they are <lb/>per incuriam is not a decision which is to be lightly taken, as it <lb/>compromises consistency and certainty in the law. Having said that, it <lb/>is equally true that the judgment of a Court, which is contrary to a <lb/>decision by a hierarchically superior Court, is per incuriam, if it <lb/>proceeds in ignorance of the earlier decision or consciously enunciates <lb/>the law contrary thereto without distinguishing the decision. <lb/>9.3 A plain reading of para 32 of Bishwanath Prasad Radhey <lb/>Shyam 10 reveals that Mr. Sai Deepak is not correct in his submission. <lb/>The Supreme Court has not, in the said paragraph, disturbed, in any <lb/>manner, the presumption of validity of a granted patent. It merely <lb/>states that &quot;the grant and sealing of the patent, or the decision <lb/>rendered by the Controller in the case of opposition, does not <lb/>guarantee the validity of the patent, which could be challenged before <lb/>the High Court on various grounds in revocation or infringement <lb/>proceedings&quot;. To this proposition, there can obviously be no cavil. <lb/>There is, however, an obvious etymological difference between a <lb/>&quot;guarantee of validity&quot; and a &quot;presumption of validity&quot;. Grant of <lb/>patent cannot, obviously, guarantee its validity; else, a granted patent <lb/>would become immune from challenge. It is inconceivable that such a <lb/>contention could even be urged, far less countenanced. Mr. Sethi <lb/>submits that, while grant of a patent does not guarantee its validity, <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">CS(COMM) 69/2021 &amp; CS(COMM) 611/2019 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 19 of 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>there is, to an extent that the defendant assailing the patent would <lb/>have to produce cogent material to support the challenge, a <lb/>presumption that, in the absence of a credible challenge, the patent is <lb/>valid. Mr. Sethi has also drawn my attention to judgments which have <lb/>taken the fact that a patent was granted as a point in favour of its <lb/>validity. <lb/>9.4 Section 13(4), too, does not deal with presumption of validity <lb/>of a granted patent. It states that &quot;the examination and investigations <lb/>required under section 12 and this section shall not be deemed in any <lb/>way to warrant the validity of any patent&quot;. The expression used here <lb/>is, once again, &quot;warrant&quot; which, etymologically, is akin to the <lb/>expression used by the Supreme Court, i.e. &quot;guarantee&quot;. Grant of <lb/>patent, or the extent to which the application for such grant has been <lb/>subjected to examination, investigation or scrutiny prior to the grant, <lb/>cannot and does not either guarantee or warrant its validity. Mr. Sethi <lb/>is, however, correct that, once the patent is granted, the onus to make <lb/>out a credible challenge to its validity would rest squarely on the <lb/>defendant. <lb/>9.5 I do not deem it necessary to devote any further time to this <lb/>aspect, as it is nobody&apos;s case that, merely by a patent being granted, <lb/>the Court can avoid examining the merits of the challenge to its <lb/>validity. In any event, as I am proceeding to examine the contentions <lb/>of Mr. Sai Deepak on merits, the issue of presumed validity <lb/></body>

			<body>consequent on grant of a patent need not burden this judgment any <lb/>further. <lb/>10. Standard of challenge <lb/>10.1 Mr. Sai Deepak contends that, at the interlocutory stage, the <lb/>defendant is not required to prove, to the hilt, the invalidity of the suit <lb/>patent. The defendant is only required to set up a credible challenge <lb/>to the vulnerability of the suit patent. Mr. Sethi, for the plaintiff, does <lb/>not dispute this position. He, however, refers me to the judgment of <lb/>Dr. S. Muralidhar, J. (as he then was), sitting singly, in Strix v. <lb/>Maharaja Appliances 11 , which delineates the &quot;standard of credibility&quot; <lb/>of the challenge which the defendant is required to pose, to the <lb/>validity of the suit patent. <lb/>10.2 The plaintiff in Strix 11 asserted a patent granted in respect of a <lb/>liquid heating vessel with certain special characteristics, and alleged <lb/>infringement of the patent by the defendant. One of the principal <lb/>defences to the challenge, as raised by the defendant, was that the <lb/>plaintiff&apos;s patent was earlier taught by a European patent which, <lb/>therefore, constituted prior art and divested the plaintiff&apos;s patent of <lb/>novelty. Without entering into the niceties of the challenge, suffice it <lb/>to state that this Court found that the invention patented by the <lb/>European patent was different from the subject matter of the suit <lb/>patent asserted by the plaintiff and that, therefore, the European patent <lb/>11 2009 SCC OnLine Del 2825 <lb/></body>

			<body>could not be regarded as, prima facie, prior art which taught the <lb/>plaintiff&apos;s invention. Paras 21 to 23 of the report alone are relevant <lb/>and may, therefore, be reproduced as under: <lb/>&quot;21. The essential difference between the product <lb/>manufactured using the Strix patent and the product made <lb/>using the European Patent is this: the Strix patent product is a <lb/>temperature control device which is linked to the element <lb/>itself and, therefore, when the element reaches a certain <lb/>temperature, the circuit is broken, and the device is switched <lb/>off. This prevents the overheating of the element itself. <lb/>Therefore, even if there is no liquid in the vessel and the <lb/>vessel is switched on, the element will not get damaged on <lb/>account of overheating. As far as the European Patent is <lb/>concerned, its mechanism operates by the temperature control <lb/>device sensing the temperature of the liquid and not of the <lb/>element. If there is no liquid in the vessel, the sensor will not <lb/>get activated and therefore the overheating of the element <lb/>cannot be avoided thus leading to it being damaged. It cannot, <lb/>therefore, prima facie be said that the Strix Patent is not an <lb/>inventive step over the European Patent and, therefore, is not <lb/>patentable as such. Of course, these are only tentative views <lb/>at an interlocutory stage. A final view will be taken by the <lb/>Court, at the end of the trial, upon an independent assessment <lb/>of the evidence, uninfluenced by this order. <lb/>22. <lb/>It was contended by learned counsel for the Defendant <lb/>that at an interlocutory stage, the Defendant should be held to <lb/>have discharged its burden of raising a &apos;credible challenge&apos; to <lb/>the validity of the Plaintiff&apos;s patent by merely pointing out the <lb/>existence of the European Patent. This court is unable to <lb/>agree. In order to raise a credible challenge to the validity of <lb/>a patent, even at an interlocutory stage, the Defendant will <lb/>have to place on record some acceptable scientific material, <lb/>supported or explained by the evidence of an expert, that the <lb/>Plaintiff&apos;s patent is prima facie vulnerable to revocation. The <lb/>burden on the Defendant here is greater on account of the <lb/>fact that there was no opposition, pre-grant or post-grant, to <lb/>the Plaintiff&apos;s patent. In Beecham Group Ltd v. Bristol <lb/>Laboratories Pty Ltd (1967-68) 118 CLR 618 and Australian <lb/>Broadcasting Corporation v. O&apos;Neill (2006) 229 ALR 457 it <lb/></body>

			<body>was held that the defendant alleging invalidity bears the onus <lb/>of establishing that there is &quot;a serious question&quot; to be tried. <lb/>In Hexal Australia Pty Ltd. v. Roche Therapeutics Inc. 66 <lb/>IPR 325 it was held that where the validity of a patent is <lb/>raised in interlocutory proceedings, &quot;the onus lies on the <lb/>party asserting invalidity to show that want of validity is a <lb/>triable question.&quot; <lb/>23. <lb/>In the instant case, the prior art cited by the Defendant, <lb/>i.e. the European Patent, is not even prima facie a prior art <lb/>that teaches the Plaintiff&apos;s invention. It works on a very <lb/>different principle. Further, the Defendant has been unable to <lb/>show that the Chinese supplier from whom it is purchasing <lb/>the infringing product, holds a patent for it. It is not even the <lb/>Defendant&apos;s case that the said product per se does not infringe <lb/>the Plaintiff&apos;s patent. The only defence is that the Plaintiff&apos;s <lb/>patent lacks novelty and its validity is vulnerable on the <lb/>ground of obviousness. This, for the reasons already <lb/>discussed, has not even prima facie been established by the <lb/>Defendant. It is not possible to agree with the contention that <lb/>the Plaintiff&apos;s patent is a mere trade variant of a known <lb/>product. The Plaintiff has been able to prima facie show that <lb/>it has been validly granted the patent which appears to be an <lb/>inventive step in comparison with the prior art cited by the <lb/>Defendant, viz., the European Patent. There is no merit in the <lb/>contention that in terms of Section 3(f) of the Act, the patent <lb/>ought not to have been granted since the invention is a mere <lb/>re-arrangement of known elements. In the considered view of <lb/>this court, such a contention cannot be accepted on a mere <lb/>averment by the Defendant. The Defendant will have to place <lb/>on record some scientific literature supported by some <lb/>credible expert opinion to show even prima facie that the <lb/>Defendant&apos;s product is a mere re-arrangement of already <lb/>known products. This burden has not been discharged by the <lb/>Defendant.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/></body>

			<body>10.3 Strix 11 has been followed, by this Court, in various decisions, <lb/>including Sandeep Jaidka v. Mukesh Mittal 12 , Telefonaktiebolaget <lb/>LM Ericsson v. Intex Technologies 13 , Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. <lb/>J.D. Joshi 14 and Telefonktiebolaget LM Ericsson v. Lava <lb/>International Ltd 15 . <lb/>10.4 Thus, the challenge, posed by the defendant to the validity of <lb/>the plaintiff&apos;s patent need not be such as to demonstrate, conclusively, <lb/>the invalidity thereof. It is sufficient if the defendant is able to make <lb/>out a case of the suit patent being vulnerable to revocation under the <lb/>Patents Act. This vulnerability has, however, to be demonstrated by <lb/>way of a credible challenge. The onus would be on the defendant, <lb/>therefore, to establish the credibility of the challenge raised by it. The <lb/>challenge cannot be incredible, fanciful, or moonshine. It must not <lb/>strain the sinews of acceptability. There can, however, needless to <lb/>say, be no fixed standard on the basis of which the credibility of the <lb/>challenge can be assessed. It would be for the Court, in each case, <lb/>therefore, to ascertain, for itself, whether the challenge raised by the <lb/>defendant, to the validity of the suit patent, is, or is not, credible. <lb/>10.5 I cannot understand Strix 11 as, however, in every case, requiring <lb/>the defendant to provide expert evidence to support its credible <lb/>challenge.

			<body>similarity between the invention patented by the European patent and <lb/>the invention claimed in the suit patent has, necessarily, to be <lb/>understood in the context of the facts before this Court. As the <lb/>distinction between the subject matter of the European patent and the <lb/>subject matter of the suit patent was found to essentially relate to the <lb/>technical characteristics of the invention, this Court opined that, in the <lb/>absence of any technical expert evidence produced by the defendant, <lb/>it could not be said that the defendant had discharged the onus, cast on <lb/>it, to show that the suit patent was vulnerable to challenge. It would, <lb/>however, be perfectly open to the defendant, in a given case, to make <lb/>out a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit patent on the <lb/>basis of other material, without having to necessarily take recourse to <lb/>expert evidence. While, therefore, being unable to agree with Mr. <lb/>Sethi that, no expert evidence having been produced by the defendant <lb/>in the present case, it could not be said that the defendant had not <lb/>raised a credible challenge, it still remains to be assessed whether, in <lb/>fact, a credible challenge to the vulnerability of the suit patent IN&apos;307, <lb/>in the present case, has been raised by the defendant, on the grounds <lb/>urged by it. <lb/>11. Disclosure vis-à-vis invalidity on the ground of obviousness <lb/>11.1 Mr. Sai Deepak advances, principally, three contentions to <lb/>support his submission that CTPR was disclosed by the genus patent, <lb/>i.e., Claim 22 in IN&apos;978.

			<body>11.5 Mr. Sethi submits, per contra, that neither can the Markush <lb/>structure claimed in Claim 1 in IN&apos;307, nor can CTPR itself, be said <lb/>to be disclosed in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. He submits that a person <lb/>skilled in the art would not be able to arrive at CTPR from the <lb/>embodiments or suggestions provided in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, without <lb/>cherry picking selective radicals for substitution in the Markush <lb/>moiety disclosed in the said Claim. This, he submits, is precisely <lb/>what the defendant has done, in arriving at CTPR from the disclosure <lb/>in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. In examining whether the genus patent taught, <lb/>or disclosed the specie patent, Mr. Sethi submits that the approach has <lb/>to be one of a person ordinarily skilled in the art. Such a person was <lb/>required to be non-inventive and incapable of creative inputs. For this <lb/>purpose, Mr. Sethi cites General Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Firestone <lb/>Tyre &amp; Rubber Co. 18 , Eli Lilly v. Zenith Goldline Pharmaceuticals 19 <lb/>and Bishwanath Prasad Radhey Shyam 10 . <lb/>11.6 Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, submits Mr. Sethi, is a Markush claim <lb/>covering millions of compounds. Such a Markush claim does not, in <lb/>any manner, disentitle patenting of any select compound, not <lb/>disclosed in the Markush claim, but within the coverage thereof. This, <lb/>he submits, is the entire concept of genus and specie patents, for <lb/>which statutory sanction is also to be found in Section 10(5) of the <lb/>Patents Act 20 , which permits patenting of an inventive concept <lb/></body>

			<body>covering a group of interlinked inventions. Patents, he submits, may <lb/>legitimately be granted to selection inventions, derived from the vast <lb/>number of compounds covered by the Markush coverage in the genus <lb/>patent. No embodiment in IN&apos;978, Mr. Sethi submits, teaches CTPR, <lb/>and the defendant, too, has not referred to any specific embodiment or <lb/>embodiments in that regard. For this proposition, Mr. Sethi relies on <lb/>the decision of the Chancery Division of the High Court of UK in In <lb/>re. I. G. Farbenindustrie A.G.&apos;s Patents 21 . For the proposition that <lb/>individual specie patents may be granted to compounds which fall <lb/>within the coverage of the genus patent, Mr. Sethi cites the judgment, <lb/>dated 8 th December, 2015 of the Division Bench of this Court in F. <lb/>Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v. Cipla Ltd 22 , the judgments of Single <lb/>Benches of this Court in Eisai Co. Ltd v. Satish Reddy 23 and Bristol <lb/>Myers Squibb Holdings v.

			<body>11.7 Novartis 17 , submits Mr. Sethi, has no application for a variety <lb/>of reasons. Firstly, Novartis 17 deals with the issue of patentability of <lb/>the invention claimed by Novartis AG, the appellant before the <lb/>Supreme Court, in the light of Section 3(d) 28 of the Patents Act. In a <lb/>case where the Court is approached on the issue of patentability, by <lb/>the applicant-plaintiff whose application for patent has been refused, <lb/>the onus to establish patentability, points out Mr. Sethi, is on the <lb/>aggrieved applicant-plaintiff. <lb/>As against this, in case of an <lb/>infringement challenge, where the defendant pleads vulnerability of <lb/>the granted patent, the onus is on the defendant to show that the patent <lb/>is vulnerable to challenge. Secondly, the Supreme Court proceeded, <lb/>in that case, on its initial finding that the genus patent constituted prior <lb/>art, whereas, in the present case, IN&apos;978 does not, in his submission, <lb/>constitute prior art for Claim 1 in IN&apos;307 or for CTPR. Thirdly, the <lb/>Supreme Court found that there was, in the genus patent, clear <lb/>disclosure of the salt constituting the specie patent, within the claim of <lb/>the genus patent, as the genus patent included &quot;Imatinib and its <lb/>pharmaceutically acceptable salts&quot;, and Imatinib Mesylate, the β-<lb/>crystalline form of which was the subject matter of dispute, was a <lb/>pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib. Fourthly, Mr. Sethi <lb/>28 &quot;3. <lb/>What are not inventions -<lb/>The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act, -<lb/>***** <lb/>(d) <lb/>the mere discovery of a new form of a known substance which does not result <lb/>in the enhancement of the known efficacy of that substance or the mere discovery of any <lb/>new property or new use for a known substance or of the mere use of a known process, <lb/>machine or apparatus unless such known process results in a new product or employs at <lb/>least one new reactant. <lb/>Explanation. -For the purposes of this clause, salts, esters, ethers, polymorphs, <lb/>metabolites, pure form, particle size, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes, <lb/>combinations and other derivatives of known substance shall be considered to be the <lb/>same substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy;&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>submits that, while Novartis 17 was a decision essentially predicated on <lb/>Section 3(d), that provision does not come in for consideration at all, <lb/>in the present case, as CTPR, according to the plaintiff, is neither <lb/>claimed nor disclosed in IN&apos;978. Arguendo and without prejudice, <lb/>Mr. Sethi submits that Novartis 17 did not hold, as Mr. Sai Deepak <lb/>would seek to contend, that there was no distinction between coverage <lb/>and disclosure. All it held was that no &quot;wide gap&quot; could be said to <lb/>exist, between these two concepts in Indian patent law. Nor, submits <lb/>Mr. Sethi, has the Supreme Court ultimately held, in Novartis 17 , that <lb/>the specie patent could not be granted. For all these reasons, <lb/>according to Mr. Sethi, the decision in Novartis 17 cannot advance the <lb/>case of the defendant. <lb/>11.8 I proceed, now, to address the three grounds raised by Mr. Sai <lb/>Deepak, on the basis of which it is sought to be contended that CTPR <lb/>was disclosed in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. While doing so, it has to be <lb/>borne in mind that the plaintiff is not asserting that there is no <lb/>disclosure in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. The contention of the plaintiff is <lb/>that what is disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, is the Markush structure <lb/>visualised therein, and not CTPR or any moiety on which, by effecting <lb/>substitutions in keeping with the embodiments provided in the said <lb/>Claim, a person skilled in the art would be taught how to arrive at <lb/>CTPR. <lb/>11.9 Viewed thus, Section 11(2)(b) cannot support the conclusion <lb/>that Mr. Sai Deepak would seek to draw from it. The defendant has, <lb/></body>

			<body>in its written submissions, specifically pointed out that it is not <lb/>contesting the patentability of a Markush structure or Markush <lb/>formula, as the Indian Patent Office accepts such applications. The <lb/>specific submission, in this regard, as it figures in para-28 of the <lb/>written submissions dated 29 th November, 2020, filed by the <lb/>defendant, reads thus: <lb/>&quot;As regards Markush claims, it is clarified that the Defendant <lb/>herein has no objection per se Markush type claims since they <lb/>are accepted by the Indian Patent Office. The Defendant&apos;s <lb/>limited argument is that if a Markush claim in an Indian <lb/>patent or Patent Application with an earlier priority date <lb/>subsumes within its ambit the specific claim or even a <lb/>Markush claim of a subsequently filed patent application, then <lb/>the former anticipates the latter within the meaning of Section <lb/>13(1)(b).&quot; <lb/>In advancing such an argument, the defendant is, in my view, <lb/>attempting to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. Once the <lb/>defendant accepts that Markush claims are patentable, it no longer <lb/>remains open to the defendant to rely on Section 11(2)(b) to advance <lb/>an argument that, as Claim 22 in IN&apos;978 was patented, there must be a <lb/>presumption of disclosure of CTPR therein. The plaintiff&apos;s assertion, <lb/>per contra, is that Claim 22 in IN&apos;978 claimed a Markush structure, <lb/>which does not claim, teach or disclose CTPR, or the Markush <lb/>structure claimed in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, even if CTPR may come <lb/>within the coverage of Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. Section 11(2)(b) cannot, <lb/>therefore, advance the case of the defendant. <lb/>11.10 Mr. Sai Deepak&apos;s second contention, on facts, is that CTPR <lb/>stands taught by the Markush structure in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, as, <lb/></body>

			<body>effecting substitutions in accordance with the embodiments provided <lb/>in the said Claim itself, it is possible for a person skilled in the art to <lb/>synthesise CTPR, as well as the Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 <lb/>of IN&apos;307. A bare reading of para 102 of the written statement filed <lb/>by the defendant, juxtaposed with para 101 thereof, clearly reveals the <lb/>fallacy of this argument. The defendant has, in arriving at CTPR from <lb/>the Markush structure claimed in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, clearly cherry <lb/>picked, in para 102, specific substitutions out of the multifarious <lb/>options provided in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, for each variable radical. <lb/>The various substitutions effected on the Markush structure claimed in <lb/>Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 by the defendant, in order to arrive at CTPR, may <lb/>be depicted thus: <lb/>The above structure, when seen in juxtaposition with the explanation <lb/>provided by the defendant in paras 101 and 102 of the written <lb/>statement, reveals that, on the Markush structure provided in Claim 22 <lb/></body>

			<body>membered or 6-membered heteroaromatic rings, out of the <lb/>multifarious choices provided in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, so as to arrive at <lb/>CTPR, or the Markush structure in Claim 1 in IN&apos;307. No <lb/>explanation for selecting these particular substitutions, out of the <lb/>several substitutions provided in the Markush claim in IN&apos;978, is <lb/>forthcoming in the pleadings. It is apparent that these substitutions <lb/>have been carefully selected so as to arrive at the Markush structure <lb/>claimed in Claim 1 in IN&apos;307, or at CTPR. Perhaps unwittingly, the <lb/>pleadings and the written statement as much as acknowledge this fact, <lb/>by the repeated use of the words &quot;in this case&quot; while referring to the <lb/>selected substitutions in para 102 (as underscored in para 102 of the <lb/>written statement as extracted in para 11.3 supra). The use of the <lb/>words &quot;in this case&quot; amount to a tacit acknowledgement of the fact <lb/>that the substitutions were selected so as to suit &quot;this case&quot;, i.e. so as <lb/>to arrive at CTPR. Prima facie, a person skilled in the art would not <lb/>selectively choose the substitutions unless she, or he, is aware of the <lb/>fact that, ultimately, CTPR is to be produced. No such effort having <lb/>been made for all the years during which IN&apos;978 remained valid, and <lb/>the plaintiff being the first to synthesise CTPR from the Markush <lb/>moiety claim then disclosed in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, it is not possible <lb/>to accept the contention of the defendant that the embodiments <lb/>provided in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978 would &quot;lead&quot; a person skilled in the <lb/>art to CTPR. No teaching, so as to enable such a person to synthesise <lb/>CTPR can, therefore, be said, prima facie, to exist in the disclosure <lb/>provided in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. It cannot, therefore, be said that <lb/></body>

			<body>Claim 22 in IN&apos;978 teaches either the Markush structure in Claim 1 in <lb/>IN&apos;307 or, more particularly, CTPR. <lb/>11.12 In Herbert Markman v. Westview 29 (which was followed, by <lb/>the Division Bench of this Court in F. Hoffman La Roche 8 ), it has <lb/>been held that any analysis of patent infringement entails two steps, <lb/>the first being determination of the meaning and scope of the <lb/>allegedly infringed patent claims and the second, comparison of the <lb/>properly construed claim with the allegedly infringing device. In the <lb/>present case, Mr. Sai Deepak would contend that Claim 1 of IN&apos;307 <lb/>infringes Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. There is no gainsaying that both are, in <lb/>essence, Markush claims. CTPR is specifically exemplified in the <lb/>specifications accompanying IN&apos;307. There is, equally, no gainsaying <lb/>that, by effecting substitutions on the Markush moiety as suggested in <lb/>para 102 of the written statement filed by the defendant, it might be <lb/>possible to arrive at the Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307 <lb/>or even at CTPR. That, however, does not end the search. The <lb/>question to be asked is -why would a person skilled in the art make <lb/>the substitutions on the Markush moiety disclosed in Claim 22 of <lb/>IN&apos;978, out of the several substitutions envisaged in the said claim? <lb/>Does IN&apos;978 teach, or instruct, a person skilled in the art to effect <lb/>these particular substitutions in order to achieve the results, or <lb/>advantages, which CTPR provides? If the answer to this question is <lb/>in the affirmative then, possibly, a case of infringement may exist, and <lb/>Claim 1 in IN&apos;307 might become vulnerable. If, however, the answer <lb/></body>

			<body>to this question is in the negative, then, the fact that, by effecting <lb/>selected substitutions on the Markush moiety disclosed in Claim 22 of <lb/>IN&apos;978, the defendant has been able to arrive at the Markush moiety <lb/>claimed in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, or even at CTPR, would not lead to an <lb/>inference of infringement or even make out a case of vulnerability, of <lb/>Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, to revocation. <lb/>11.13 No answer to this &quot;why&quot; poser is provided in the written <lb/>statement filed by the defendant, or in the oral or written submissions <lb/>of the defendant. I have, therefore, perused, with care, the complete <lb/>specifications relating to IN&apos;978 and, specifically, Claim 22 therein. I <lb/>am unable to find, in the complete specifications, any &quot;teaching&quot; <lb/>which would &quot;lead&quot; (to use the expression employed by the defendant <lb/>in its written statement) a person skilled in the art to Claim 1 of <lb/>IN&apos;307 or, further, to CTPR. <lb/>11.14 Reference to the principles enunciated in some judicial <lb/>authorities is, in this context, apposite: <lb/>11.14.1 <lb/>In para 50 of the report in Bishwanath Prasad Radhey <lb/>Shyam 10 , the Supreme Court, while holding that the allegedly <lb/>infringed invention was not novel, but was obvious even from the <lb/>allegedly infringing invention, opined thus: <lb/>&quot;The patented machine is merely an application of an old <lb/>invention, known for decades before 1951, for the traditional <lb/>purpose of scraping and turning utensils, with a slight change <lb/>in the mode of application, which is no more than a <lb/>&quot;workshop improvement&quot;, a normal development of an <lb/></body>

The alleged discovery does not lie outside the <lb/>track of what was known before. It would have been obvious <lb/>to any skilled worker in the field, in the state of knowledge <lb/>existing at the date of patent, of what was publicly known or <lb/>practiced before about this process, that the claim in question <lb/>viz., mere addition of a lever and bracket did not make the <lb/>invention the subject of the claim concerned. There has been <lb/>no substantial exercise of the inventive power or innovative <lb/>faculty. There is no evidence that the patented machine is the <lb/>result of any research, independent thought, ingenuity and <lb/>skill.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>11.14.2 <lb/>In Eli Lilly 19 , the Court of Appeal was concerned with an <lb/>allegation, levelled by Eli Lilly, of infringement, by the defendants <lb/>before it (collectively referred to, hereinafter, as &quot;Zenith&quot;) of its US <lb/>Patent No 5229 382 (US 382). Zenith alleged US 382 to be invalid, as <lb/>it was anticipated by an article entitled &quot;4-Piperazinyl-10H-<lb/>thieno[2,3-b][1,5] benzodiazepines as Potential Neuroleptics&quot;, from <lb/>the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry authored by Jiban K. Chakrabarti <lb/>et al (cited, in the judgement of the Court of Appeals, as &quot;Chakrabarti <lb/>1980a&quot;). The following passages, from the decision of the Court of <lb/>Appeals, are instructive: <lb/>&quot;Anticipation is a question of fact, including whether <lb/>or not an element is inherent in the prior art. See In re <lb/>Schreiber, 128 F.3d 1473,1477 (Fed.Cir.1997). Therefore, <lb/>this Court reviews a finding of anticipation under the clearly <lb/>erroneous standard. Atlas Powder Co. v. Ireco, Inc., 190 F.3d <lb/>1342,1346 (Fed.Cir.1999). To anticipate, of prior art <lb/>reference must place the inventive compound or composition <lb/>in the possession of the public. In re Brown, 51 C.C.P.A. <lb/>1254, 329 F.2d 1006,1011 (1964). Thus, the prior art <lb/>reference must disclose each and every feature of the claimed <lb/></body>

			<body>invention, either explicitly or inherently. Glaxo Inc. v. No-<lb/>vopharm Ltd., 52 F.3d 1043,1047 (Fed. Cir. 1995). <lb/>Pointing to In re Petering 49 C.C..P.A. 993,301 F.2d <lb/>676 (1962) and In re Schaumann, 572 F.2d 312 <lb/>(C.C.P.A.1987), IVAX asserts that Chakrabarti 1980a <lb/>anticipated claim 1 of the &apos;382 patent because it identified <lb/>compounds from the same family of compounds <lb/>(thienobenzodiazepines). Indeed, in Petering, the Board of <lb/>Patent Appeals affirmed the examiner&apos;s rejection of claims 1, <lb/>2, 4, 5, 7, and 10-12 of the patent applicant&apos;s application on <lb/>&quot;isoalloxazines.&quot; 301 F. 2d at 677. However, in contrast to <lb/>this case, the prior art in Petering did more than make a <lb/>broad generic disclosure. In Petering, the prior art disclosed <lb/>a limited number of specific preferences from a specifically <lb/>defined group of isoalloxazines. Id. As a result, Petering <lb/>actually disclosed to one skilled in the art a limited class of <lb/>only &quot;some 20 compounds&quot;, including &quot;6,7-dimethyl-9-<lb/>(Bmonohydroxyethyl)-isoalloxazine&quot;. Schaumann, 572 F.2d <lb/>at 315 (citing Petering, 301 F.2d at 682). <lb/>Similarly, the prior art in Schaumann disclosed 14 <lb/>compounds, later further narrowed to 7, considering express <lb/>preferences. Additionally, the structural formula of this prior <lb/>art contained but a single variable. 572 F. 2d at 314. Thus, <lb/>in Schaumann, the prior art patent embraced a very limited <lb/>number of closely related compounds and specifically <lb/>described the claimed compound. 572 F. 2d at 316. Thus, <lb/>unlike this case, the prior art in both Petering and <lb/>Schaumann expressly spelled out a definite and limited class <lb/>of compounds that enabled a person of ordinary skill in the <lb/>art to act once envisage each member of this limited class. <lb/>Schaumann, 572 F.2d at 315; Petering 301 F.2d at 681-82. <lb/>By contrast, the number of compounds actually <lb/>disclosed by Chakrabarti 1980a numbers in the millions <lb/>(including <lb/>all <lb/>proposed <lb/>alternative <lb/>substituents). <lb/>Chakrabarti 1980a examine forty five specific compounds <lb/>(as opposed to a genus of compounds) in the 4-Piperazinyl-<lb/>10H-thieno[2,3-b][1,5]benzodiazepines family and fourteen <lb/>analogous <lb/>5-piperazinyl-substituted <lb/>4H-thieno[2,3-<lb/>b][1,4]benzodiazepines, which were created to compare <lb/></body>

			<body>activity. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, 364 F. <lb/>Supp. 2d at 848. Indeed, Chakrabarti 1980a listed several <lb/>preferred compounds and substituents, none of which <lb/>resemble olanzapine: <lb/>for <lb/>R-a <lb/>methyl, <lb/>hydroxyethyl, <lb/>or <lb/>hydroxypropyl; <lb/>for R1-a fluorine, chlorine, or 7, 8, difluoro [no <lb/>hydrogen]: and <lb/>for R2 -a methyl, 2-ethyl, or 2-isopropyl group. <lb/>Id at 848. Five of the preferred individual compounds (9, 12, <lb/>17, 29, and 34) are more potent than clozapine (scoring a 3 <lb/>CAR or higher) and having clozapine-like effect. For those <lb/>five preferred compounds, the Chakrabarti 1980a authors <lb/>expressed a preference for specific, complete compounds <lb/>without any variation of the individual substituents on those <lb/>molecules. Chakrabarti 1980a also always expressed a <lb/>preference for halogen-containing compounds (fluorine or <lb/>chlorine), not hydrogen. Id. At 832-33. Furthermore, <lb/>compounds 9, 12, 17 and 29 all have fluorine at the 7-position <lb/>of the benzene ring. And though Compound 34 does have <lb/>hydrogen the 7-position of the benzene ring, it has a <lb/>hydroxyethyl on its piperazine ring, unlike olanzapine. Id. In <lb/>sum, Chakrabarti 1980a discloses nothing close to the <lb/>claimed invention. <lb/>Chakrabarti 1980a does provide a general structural formula <lb/>with possible substituents of &quot;R&quot;, &quot;R1&quot; and &quot;R2&quot;, but it does <lb/>not define at all. Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, <lb/>364 F.Supp.2d at 900. No possible combination of those <lb/>preferred substituents would lead to the components that <lb/>make up olanzapine, because each would contain a fluorine or <lb/>a chlorine. To make olanzapine from Chakrabarti 1980a, one <lb/>would have to depart from the teaching of the article and <lb/>recombine the components of the specific illustrative <lb/>compounds with hindsight. Thus, Chakrabarti 1980a does not <lb/>anticipate because: (1) the article prefers complete <lb/>compounds, not individual substituents, (2) the article <lb/>discloses no generic disclosure encompassing olanzapine or <lb/></body>

			<body>even stating that substituents on different compounds were <lb/>interchangeable, and (3) the article does not suggest <lb/>transforming unpreferred compounds 7 into a preferred <lb/>compound. <lb/>Thus, Chakrabarti 1980a did not place <lb/>olanzapine in the possession of the public.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>11.14.3 <lb/>Apotex 27 was a judgement of the Supreme Court of <lb/>Canada, particularly dealing with the validity of selection patents. <lb/>The respondent in that case (&quot;Sanofi&quot;, in short) was the holder of a <lb/>Canadian patent &apos;875, which disclosed a genus or class of compounds <lb/>useful in inhibiting platelet aggregation activity in the blood. Over <lb/>250,000 possible different compounds, useful for this purpose, were <lb/>disclosed by the &apos;875 patent. One such compound was a racemate, <lb/>which is a substance containing equal amounts of two structurally <lb/>different compounds, called enantiomers or optical isomers, namely <lb/>the dextro-rotatory and the levo-rotatory isomer. Sanofi&apos;s subsequent <lb/>patent (&quot;the 777 patent&quot;) disclosed and claimed clopidogrel <lb/>bisulphate, an anti-coagulant which inhibited platelet aggregation <lb/>activity in the blood. It was an admitted position that clopidogrel <lb/>bisulphate was encompassed within the scope of the claims in the <lb/>&apos;875 patent and that clopidogrel was the dextro-rotatory isomer of the <lb/>racemate, which added beneficial properties over both the racemate <lb/>and its levorotatory isomer. Clopidogrel bisulphate was a salt of <lb/>clopidogrel, which had a better therapeutic index than the salts of the <lb/>racemic mixture. The advantage of clopidogrel bisulphate or, for that <lb/>matter, even clopidogrel, over the racemate and the levorotatory <lb/>isomer was, therefore, admitted. <lb/></body>

			<body>11.14.3.1 Apotex served a notice on Sanofi, alleging that the 777 <lb/>patent was invalid on the ground of anticipation, obviousness and <lb/>double patenting. Sanofi contended, per contra, that clopidogrel <lb/>bisulphate was a selection patent, out of the moieties disclosed in the <lb/>&apos;875 patent. <lb/>11.14.3.2 The Court first referred to the decision in <lb/>Farbenindustrie 21 , terming it the locus classicus describing selection <lb/>patents. On this, paras 9 and 10 of the judgment read thus: <lb/>&quot;9. <lb/>The locus classicus describing selection patents is the <lb/>decision of Maugham J. in In re. I.G. Farbenindustrie A.G.&apos;s <lb/>Patents (1930), 47 R.P.C 289 (Ch. D.). At p. 321, he <lb/>explained that in the field of chemical patents (which would <lb/>of course include pharmaceutical compounds), there are often <lb/>two &quot;sharply divided classes&quot;. The first class of patents, <lb/>which he called originating patents, are based on an <lb/>originating invention, namely, the discovery of a new reaction <lb/>or a new compound. The second class comprises patents <lb/>based on a selection of compounds from those described in <lb/>general terms and claimed in the originating patent. <lb/>Maugham J. cautioned that the selected compounds cannot <lb/>have been made before, or the selection patent &quot;would fail for <lb/>want of novelty&quot;. But if the selected compounds is &quot;novel&quot; <lb/>and &quot;possess[es] a special property of an unexpected <lb/>character&quot;, the required &quot;inventive&quot; step would be satisfied <lb/>(p. 321). At p. 322, Maugham J. stated that a selection patent <lb/>&quot;does not in its nature differ from any other patent&quot;. <lb/>10. <lb/>While not exhaustively defining a selection patent, he <lb/>set out (at pp. 322-23) three conditions that must be satisfied <lb/>for a selection patent to be valid. <lb/>1. <lb/>There must be a substantial advantage to be <lb/>secured or disadvantage to be avoided by the use of the <lb/>selected members. <lb/></body>

			<body>2. <lb/>The whole of the selected members (subject to <lb/>&quot;a few exceptions here and there&quot;) possess the <lb/>advantage in question. <lb/>3. <lb/>The selection must be in respect of a quality of <lb/>a special character peculiar to the selected group. If <lb/>further research revealed a small number of unselected <lb/>compounds possessing the same advantage, that would <lb/>not invalidate the selection patent. However, if <lb/>research showed that a large number of unselected <lb/>compounds possess the same advantage, the quality of <lb/>the compound claimed in the selection patent would <lb/>not be of a special character.&quot; <lb/>[Though the Patents Act does not specifically refer to &quot;selection <lb/>patents&quot;, so long as (a) the invention, as selected from the Markush <lb/>moiety in the genus patent, fulfils the description of &quot;invention&quot;, (b) <lb/>involves, in its fabrication of creation, an &quot;inventive step&quot;, within the <lb/>meaning of clauses (i) and (ja) of Section 2, and (c) does not suffer <lb/>from any of the disabilities envisaged by Section 64 of the Patents <lb/>Act, it is, ex facie, patentable. There is no reason, therefore, why the <lb/>criteria of the patentability, qua selection patents, enumerated in <lb/>Farbenindustrie 21 , should not apply in this country as well.] The <lb/>Court, thereafter, went on to quote the following test, for obviousness <lb/>in a patent, from Beloit Canada Ltd v. Valmet Oy 30 : <lb/>&quot;The test for obviousness is not to ask what competent <lb/>inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. <lb/>Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone <lb/>for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having <lb/>no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of <lb/>deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph <lb/>of the left hemisphere over the right. The question to be <lb/>30 (1986) 8 CPR (3d) 289 <lb/></body>

			<body>asked is whether this mythical creature (the man in the <lb/>Clapham omnibus of patent law) would, in the light of the <lb/>state of the art and common general knowledge as at the <lb/>claimed date of invention, have come directly and without <lb/>difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very <lb/>difficult test to satisfy.&quot; <lb/>In principle, I am inclined to agree with this test, to determine whether <lb/>a patent discloses a particular invention or moiety which becomes, <lb/>therefore, obvious from the patent. From the teachings in the genus <lb/>patent, the person skilled in the art must be in a position to arrive, <lb/>without unduly straining his imaginative and creative faculties, at the <lb/>specie patent, in order for the specie patent to be invalidated on the <lb/>ground of obviousness. The element of &quot;directness&quot; must be there. <lb/>The choice which the person skilled in the art would make, by way of <lb/>substitutions on the Markush moiety or otherwise, must be apparent <lb/>from the teachings in the genus patent, in order for the specie patent to <lb/>be treated as &quot;obvious&quot;. A &quot;trial and error&quot; approach would be <lb/>antithetical to any suggestion of &quot;obviousness&quot;. <lb/>11.14.3.3 Apotex 27 went on to discuss, in detail, the legal situation <lb/>as it prevailed in Canada. It is not necessary to embark on that <lb/>discussion here; however, the following discussion on the facts of that <lb/>case, in paras 70, 72 and 73 of the opinion of the Court, apply, mutatis <lb/>mutandis, to the case on hand: <lb/>&quot;[70] It is well known that the pharmaceutical industry is <lb/>intensely competitive. Market participants are continuously in <lb/>search of new and improved medications and want to reach <lb/>the market with them as soon as possible. So demand for an <lb/>effective and non-toxic product to inhibit platelet aggregation <lb/>might be assumed to exist. However, nothing in the &apos;875 <lb/></body>

			<body>patent or common general knowledge provided a specific <lb/>motivation for the skilled person to pursue the &apos;777 invention. <lb/>The prior patent was a genus patent, and selection might be <lb/>expected. However, the prior patent did not differentiate <lb/>between the efficacy and the toxicity of any of the compounds <lb/>it covered. This suggests that what to select or omit was not <lb/>then self-evident to the person skilled in the art. <lb/>[72] The methods to obtain the invention of the &apos;777 patent <lb/>were common general knowledge. It can be assumed that <lb/>there was a motive to find a non-toxic efficacious product to <lb/>inhibit platelet aggregation in the blood. However, it was not <lb/>self-evident from the &apos;875 patent or common general <lb/>knowledge what the properties of the dextro-rotatory isomer <lb/>of this racemate would be or what the bisulfate salt&apos;s <lb/>beneficial properties would be and therefore that what was <lb/>being tried ought to work. The course of conduct and the time <lb/>involved throughout demonstrate that the advantage of the <lb/>dextro-rotatory isomer was not quickly or easily predictable. <lb/>Had the dextro-rotatory isomer been &quot;obvious to try&quot;, it is <lb/>difficult to believe that Sanofi would not have opted for it <lb/>before unnecessary time and investment were spent on the <lb/>racemate. I conclude that the prior art and common general <lb/>knowledge of persons skilled in the art at the relevant time <lb/>were not sufficient for it to be more or less self-evident to try <lb/>to find the dextro-rotatory isomer. <lb/>[73] As I have earlier explained, there was a significant <lb/>difference between the &apos;875 genus patent and the &apos;777 <lb/>selection patent. The difference was not obvious. Having <lb/>regard to the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the allegation <lb/>of obviousness is not justified.&quot; <lb/>11.14.4 <lb/>Yet another decision, from overseas, which is instructive, <lb/>is the judgment of the UK Court of Appeal in Dr Reddy&apos;s <lb/>Laboratories 26 which again dealt with olanzapine.

			<body>generalised coverage of such claims was expressed, in the said <lb/>decision, thus: <lb/>&quot;An old question and answer runs as a follows: &quot;Where does <lb/>a wise man hide a leaf? In a forest.&quot; It is, at least faintly, <lb/>ridiculous to say that a particular leaf has been made available <lb/>to you by telling you that it is in Sherwood Forest. Once <lb/>identified, you can of course see it. But if not identified you <lb/>know only the generality: that Sherwood Forest has millions <lb/>of leaves. <lb/>The contention has no logical stopping place. If there is <lb/>disclosure of olanzapine here, why would one not regard an <lb/>even more general disclosure as a disclosure of it. Suppose <lb/>the prior art had merely been of &quot;3-ringed organic <lb/>compounds?&quot; Such a description would encompass much <lb/>much bigger numbers than the 1019 of formula I. Yet the <lb/>logic of the argument would be the same -that there is a <lb/>disclosure of each and every member of the class. <lb/>I would add that I would regard the listing out of a great <lb/>number of compounds as opposed to the use of a Markush <lb/>formula in the same way. To say a particular book is <lb/>identified by saying &quot;the books in the Bodleian&quot; is no <lb/>different from saying it is identified by providing access to <lb/>the catalogue of the Bodleian. <lb/>Similarly it makes no sense to say that a generalised prior <lb/>description discloses a specific matter falling within in (sic). <lb/>The judge&apos;s example illustrates the point. A prior disclosure <lb/>of &quot;fixing means&quot; is not a disclosure of a particular fixing <lb/>means e.g. welding or riveting even though you could list out <lb/>a whole number of ways of fixing things together which <lb/>would include these means. <lb/>Thus logic dictates rejection of the argument that a disclosure <lb/>of a large class is a disclosure of each and every member of <lb/>it.&quot; <lb/>These paragraphs, in the opinion of this Court, condense, in <lb/>themselves, the very essence of the concepts of disclosure and <lb/></body>

			<body>11.15.4 <lb/>In the application, Novartis claimed that the β-crystalline <lb/>form of Imatinib Mesylate was superior to the α-crystalline form of <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate as it had more beneficial flow properties, better <lb/>thermodynamic stability and lower hygroscopicity. The patent <lb/>application of Novartis did not, however, claim any superiority, of the <lb/>β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, over the Imatinib freebase. <lb/>Rather, it was admitted, in the patent application, that &quot;all indicated <lb/>inhibitory and pharmacological effects&quot; of the β-crystalline form of <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate were &quot;also found with the freebase&quot;. Subsequent <lb/>to amendment of the Patents Act, however, Novartis filed four <lb/>affidavits of experts, in which it was claimed that the β-crystalline <lb/>form of Imatinib Mesylate had &quot;much higher bioavailability&quot;, as <lb/>compared to the freebase Imatinib. <lb/>11.15.5 <lb/>In its patent application, Novartis cited 18 th July, 1997 as <lb/>the &quot;priority date&quot; 31 of the patent, being the date on which Novartis <lb/>31 &quot;Priority date&quot; is defined, in Section 2(w), as having &quot;the meaning assigned to it by Section 11.

Even while holding that (i) the product sought to be <lb/>patented by Novartis, i.e. the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, <lb/>satisfied the tests of novelty and non-obviousness and (ii) Novartis <lb/>was entitled to claim 18 th July, 1997 as the priority date (for which <lb/>purpose the IPAB relied on Section 133), the IPAB held that the <lb/>product was, nonetheless, not patentable in view of Section 3(d) of the <lb/>Patents Act which, according to the IPAB, set a &quot;requirement of <lb/>higher standard of inventive step in the law particularly for <lb/>drug/pharmaceutical substances&quot;. The IPAB held, however, that <lb/>Novartis was entitled to patent in respect of the process for <lb/>manufacture of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. <lb/>11.15.8 <lb/>Novartis directly approached the Supreme Court, <lb/>challenging the aforesaid order of the IPAB. While criticising <lb/>Novartis for having bypassed the available remedy before the High <lb/>Court, the Supreme Court, in view of the importance and intricacy of <lb/>the issue involved, agreed, by consent, to decide the appeal on merits. <lb/>Thus came to be passed the judgement under discussion. <lb/></body>

			<body>11.15.9 <lb/>The Supreme Court observed, initially, that Section 5, <lb/>which permitted patenting only of inventions for methods or process <lb/>of manufacture and, therefore, prohibited grant of patent to substances <lb/>intended for use, or capable of being used, as food or medicine or <lb/>drug or prepared or produced by chemical processes, was deleted, <lb/>w.e.f. 1 st January, 2005, by the Patents (Amendment) Act, 2005 (&quot;the <lb/>2005 Amendment Act&quot;, hereinafter). The Supreme Court proceeded, <lb/>thereafter, from paras 29 to 72 of the report, to trace the entire history <lb/>of the Patents Act, as well as the various amendments thereto, from <lb/>time to time. Thereafter, the Supreme Court proceeded to extract <lb/>clauses (ac), (j) and (ja) of Section 2 32 and delineate, in para 74, the <lb/>three conditions, cumulatively required to be satisfied in order for a <lb/>product to qualify as an &quot;invention&quot;, thus: <lb/>&quot;Section 2(1)(j) requires a product to satisfy three conditions <lb/>to qualify as an invention: <lb/>(i) <lb/>It must be &quot;new&quot;, that is to say it must not have <lb/>been anticipated; <lb/>(ii) <lb/>Its coming into being must involve an <lb/>&quot;inventive step&quot;; and <lb/>(iii) It must be &quot;capable of industrial application&quot;, <lb/>that is to say it must be capable of being made or used <lb/>in an industry [Section 2(1)(ac)].&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis in original) <lb/>32 &quot;2. <lb/>Definitions and interpretation -<lb/>(1) <lb/>In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires, -<lb/>***** <lb/>(ac) <lb/>&quot;capable of industrial application&quot;, in relation to any invention, means that the <lb/>invention is capable of being made or used in an industry; <lb/>***** <lb/>(j) <lb/>&quot;invention&quot; means a new product or process involving an inventive step and <lb/>capable of industrial application; <lb/>(ja) <lb/>&quot;inventive step&quot; means a feature of an invention that involves technical advance <lb/>as compared to the existing knowledge or having economic significance of both and that <lb/>makes the invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art;&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>Thus was introduced, into the concept of &quot;invention&quot;, as defined in <lb/>the Patents Act, the principle of &quot;anticipation&quot;, as antithetical to <lb/>&quot;newness&quot; -or, more properly, &quot;novelty&quot;. Clearly, the Supreme <lb/>Court holds that an invention which was &quot;anticipated&quot; cannot be <lb/>regarded as &quot;novel&quot;. Para 75 went on to paraphrase clause (ja) by <lb/>holding that &quot;the invention that creates the product must have a <lb/>feature that involves technical advance as compared to the existing <lb/>knowledge or having economic significance or both and this feature <lb/>should be such as to make the invention not obvious to a person <lb/>skilled in the art&quot;. Para 76 went on to crystallise these observations <lb/>by delineating the characteristics of an &quot;invention&quot;, for the purposes <lb/>of the Patents Act, thus: <lb/>&quot;On a combined reading of clauses (j), (ac) and (ja) of <lb/>Section 2(1), in order to qualify as &quot;invention&quot;, a product <lb/>must, therefore, satisfy the following tests: <lb/>(i) <lb/>It must be &quot;new&quot;; <lb/>(ii) <lb/>It must be &quot;capable of being made or used in an <lb/>industry&quot;; <lb/>(iii) It must come into being as a result of an <lb/>invention which has a feature that: <lb/>(a) entails technical advance over existing <lb/>knowledge; <lb/>or <lb/>(b) <lb/>has an economic significance; <lb/>and <lb/>(c) <lb/>makes the invention not obvious to a <lb/>person skilled in the art.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>11.15.10 <lb/>For being entitled to grant of a patent, however, the <lb/>Supreme Court held that the product was required not only to satisfy <lb/>the tests entitling it to be regarded as an &quot;invention&quot;, but was also <lb/>required to be &quot;patentable&quot;. Section 3 of the Patents Act, it was <lb/>observed, demarcated two situations in which the right to patent could <lb/>be lawfully denied; firstly, where the product was not an &quot;invention&quot;, <lb/>such as in the case of clauses (b) and (e) 33 , and, secondly, where, <lb/>though the product was an &quot;invention&quot;, other considerations <lb/>prohibited grant of patent, such as in the case of clause (d) 28 . The <lb/>Supreme Court held, however, that it was concerned only with clause <lb/>(d). <lb/>11.15.11 <lb/>Apropos Section 3(d), the Supreme Court rejected the <lb/>contention, advanced before it, that the provision had been introduced <lb/>ex majore cautela. Section 3(d), it was held, underscored the <lb/>distinction between the concepts of invention and patentability, and <lb/>was amended, by the 2005 Amendment Act, especially to deal with <lb/>chemical substances, and more particularly with pharmaceutical <lb/>products. As amended, it was observed that Section 3(d) set up a <lb/>second <lb/>tier <lb/>of <lb/>qualifying <lb/>standards <lb/>for <lb/>chemical <lb/>33 &quot;3. <lb/>What are not inventions -<lb/>The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act, -<lb/>***** <lb/>(b) <lb/>an invention the primary or intended use or commercial exploitation of which could be <lb/>contrary to public order or morality, or which causes serious prejudice to human, animal or plant <lb/>life or health or the environment; <lb/>***** <lb/>(e) <lb/>a substance obtained by a mere admixture resulting only in the application of the <lb/>properties of the components thereof or a process for producing such substance;&quot; <lb/></body>

The importance of section 3(d), in <lb/>a case where a plea of repetitive patenting, or extension of a patent <lb/>beyond its expiry, was set up by the defendant cannot, therefore, be <lb/>gainsaid. Para 88 of the report went on to observe that, read in <lb/>conjunction, clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1), and Section 3(d), &quot;set <lb/>different standards for qualifying as &quot;invention&quot; things belonging to <lb/>different classes, and for medicinal and other chemical substances, the <lb/>Act sets the invention threshold further higher, by virtue of the <lb/>amendments made in Section 3(d) in the year 2005&quot;. <lb/>11.15.12 <lb/>Plainly, the sequitur of this observation would be that, in <lb/>the case of pharmaceutical substances, the product, in order to be <lb/>&quot;patentable&quot;, would not only have to qualify as an &quot;invention&quot;, and as <lb/>the result of an &quot;inventive step&quot;, but would also have to satisfy the <lb/>rigour of Section 3(d). Of course, this would be relevant only where, <lb/>on facts, Section 3(d) would apply, i.e. where there was an earlier <lb/>&quot;known substance&quot;, and the product/process being sought to be <lb/>patented was either <lb/>(i) <lb/>a new form of the known substance, in which case the <lb/>product was required to possess &quot;enhanced efficacy&quot;, as <lb/>compared to the &quot;known efficacy&quot; of the &quot;known substance&quot;, <lb/>or <lb/></body>

It was contended, <lb/>by Novartis, that neither of these steps was either <lb/>&quot;taught&quot; or suggested, by Example 21 of the Zimmerman <lb/>Patent, to a person skilled in the art. In producing <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate from Imatinib, therefore, it was <lb/>contended that technical advance was involved, as <lb/>compared to the existing knowledge, and the new <lb/>substance had come into being. <lb/>(b) The second invention was the invention which <lb/>Novartis desired to patent, namely the β-crystalline form <lb/>of Imatinib Mesylate. The necessity of this invention, <lb/>contended Novartis, was to ensure that Imatinib Mesylate <lb/>was suitable for administration in solid oral dosage form. <lb/>The process parameters, resulting in the creation of the β-<lb/>crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, were also required <lb/>to be defined. Novartis pointed out that the Zimmerman <lb/>Patent made no reference to polymorphism or to any <lb/>crystalline structure. The crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate was, therefore, it was contended, a distinct, and <lb/>further, invention, beyond Imatinib Mesylate itself. <lb/>While thus synthesising the β-crystalline form of <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate, suitability of administration to human <lb/>beings was also required to be ensured.

			<body>characteristics of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate with the freebase Imatinib, Novartis submitted <lb/>that the Zimmerman Patent described, at best, (i) how to <lb/>prepare the freebase Imatinib and (ii) the anti-tumour <lb/>properties of the freebase Imatinib. Both the steps <lb/>involved in proceeding from the freebase Imatinib to the <lb/>β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, therefore, it was <lb/>submitted, resulted in distinct inventions. <lb/>11.15.14 <lb/>Examination of the correctness of these contentions, <lb/>noted the Supreme Court, would involve detailed analysis of the <lb/>Zimmerman Patent and the developments that took place thereafter, <lb/>especially with respect to Novartis. These developments were set out <lb/>thus (in paras 93 to 93.11 of the report): <lb/>(i) <lb/>The application for grant of the Zimmerman Patent was <lb/>filed, by M/s Ciba Geigy, in the US, on 28 th April, 1994. (An <lb/>earlier application filed on 2 nd April, 1993 was abandoned.) <lb/>The invention declared by the application related to N-phenyl-<lb/>2-pyrimidine-amine derivatives which, in the application, were <lb/>parenthesized as &quot;Formula I&quot;, as well as their compounds, their <lb/>process of preparation and therapeutic uses.

It was further declared that the compounds of <lb/>Formula I had valuable pharmacological properties and could <lb/>be used as, inter alia, anti-tumour drugs, by &quot;(inhibiting) the <lb/>tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor for the epidermal growth <lb/>factor&quot;. By this mechanism, the application declared that the <lb/>compounds of Formula I were able to prevent metastizing of <lb/>tumours, and to achieve regression thereof. Example 21 in the <lb/>application admittedly related to Imatinib, with the chemical <lb/>formula N -{5 -[4 -[(4 -methyl -piperazinomethyl) -<lb/>benzoylamido] -2 -methylphenyl} -4 -(3 -pyridyl) -2 -<lb/>pyrimidine amine. It was further provided, under S.

US laws <lb/>also required declaration of the patent information, relating to <lb/>the new drug, while filing the NDA. Novartis, in the patent <lb/>information furnished in connection with the NDA for Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate, declared Imatinib Mesylate as the active ingredient <lb/>and, further, declared that the active ingredient, the drug <lb/>product (composition/formulation) and method of use were <lb/>covered by the Zimmerman Patent (US 184). <lb/>(iv) Approval for Gleevec (Imatinib Mesylate), in the form of <lb/>50 mg and 100 mg capsules, was granted, by the FDA, vide <lb/>letter dated 10 th May, 2001. Following this, Novartis launched <lb/>Gleevec, commercially, in the market.

This was underscored by the fact that, even in the <lb/>patent application, Novartis declared that the sole active <lb/>ingredient in Gleevec was Imatinib Mesylate. In so far as the <lb/>manner in which Imatinib Mesylate was claimed in the <lb/>Zimmerman Patent, the patent term extension application <lb/>declared thus: <lb/>&quot;Statement showing how the claims of the patent for <lb/>which extension is sought cover the approved product: <lb/>The operative claims in question are Claims 1-5, 10-13 <lb/>and 21-23. Each of Claims 1-5, 10-13 and 23 claim a <lb/>compound or compounds which include the approved <lb/>product, Imatinib Mesylate. Claim 21 claims of <lb/>composition containing a compound or compounds <lb/>which include the approved product, Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate. Claim 22 claims a method for treating <lb/>tumours in warm-blooded animals with a compound or <lb/>compounds which include the approved product, <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate.&quot; <lb/>The application was accepted and the term of the Zimmerman <lb/>Patent (US 184), otherwise due to expire on 28 th May, 2013, <lb/>was extended for 586 days. <lb/>(vi) Novartis had applied, in the US, for grant of patent for <lb/>the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. The examiner <lb/></body>

			<body>rejected the application, against which Novartis appealed to the <lb/>Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (&quot;the Board of <lb/>Patent Appeals&quot;, in short). The Board of Patent Appeals <lb/>reversed the decision of the examiner. It was held, by the <lb/>Board of Patent Appeals, that, though the Zimmerman Patent <lb/>did teach any person skilled in the art how to use Imatinib, a <lb/>compound of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt <lb/>thereof, in a pharmaceutical composition for treating tumours, <lb/>the teaching in the Zimmerman Patent did not go further, and <lb/>did not extend to the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, <lb/>which represented a &quot;manipulative step&quot; in the method of <lb/>treating tumours in patients. <lb/>11.15.15 <lb/>In view of the above, the Supreme Court held (in para <lb/>105 of the report) that the Zimmerman Patent did teach how to make <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate from Imatinib, and the use of Imatinib Mesylate in <lb/>pharmacological compositions for treating tumours, though the Board <lb/>of Patent Appeals opined that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate might not have been covered by the Zimmerman Patent. <lb/>These findings, held the Supreme Court, were binding on Novartis, <lb/>and could not be revisited. After referring to certain publications on <lb/>the issue, the submission, of Novartis, that Imatinib Mesylate was a <lb/>new invention, vis-à-vis Imatinib, involving technical advance over <lb/>existing knowledge was, unequivocally rejected by the Supreme <lb/>Court, in paras 111 and 113 of the report. Paras 105, 111 and 113 of <lb/>the report in Novartis 17 read thus: <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;105. From the above discussion it would be clear that the <lb/>drug Gleevec directly emanates from the Zimmermann Patent <lb/>and comes to the market for commercial sale. Since the grant <lb/>of the Zimmermann Patent, the appellant has maintained that <lb/>Gleevec (that is, Imatinib Mesylate) is part of the <lb/>Zimmermann Patent. It obtained drug approval for Gleevec <lb/>on that basis. It claimed extension of the term of the <lb/>Zimmermann Patent for the period of regulatory review for <lb/>Gleevec, and it successfully stopped NATCO Pharma Ltd. <lb/>from marketing its drug in UK on the basis of the <lb/>Zimmermann Patent. Not only the appellant but the US Board <lb/>of Patent Appeals, in its judgment granting patent for β-<lb/>crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, proceeded on the basis <lb/>that though the beta-crystalline form might not have been <lb/>covered by the Zimmermann Patent, the Zimmermann Patent <lb/>had the teaching for the making of Imatinib Mesylate from <lb/>Imatinib, and for its use in a pharmacological composition for <lb/>treating tumours or in a method of treating warm-blooded <lb/>animals suffering from a tumoral disease. This finding was <lb/>recorded by the US Board of Patent Appeals, in the case of <lb/>the appellant itself, on the very same issue that is now under <lb/>consideration. The appellant is, therefore, fully bound by the <lb/>finding and cannot be heard to take any contrary plea. <lb/>***** <lb/>111. In the face of the materials referred to above, we are <lb/>completely unable to see how Imatinib Mesylate can be said <lb/>to be a new product, having come into being through an <lb/>&quot;invention&quot; that has a feature that involves technical advance <lb/>over the existing knowledge and that would make the <lb/>invention not obvious to a person skilled in the art. Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate is all there in the Zimmermann Patent. It is a known <lb/>substance from the Zimmermann Patent. <lb/>***** <lb/>113. We thus find no force in the submission that the <lb/>development of Imatinib Mesylate from Imatinib is outside <lb/>the Zimmermann Patent and constitutes an invention as <lb/>understood in the law of patent in India.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>11.15.16 <lb/>Paras 114 and 116 of the report went on to record certain <lb/>submissions, advanced by learned Senior Counsel for Novartis, which <lb/>are of considerable significance insofar as the controversy in issue <lb/>before me is concerned and which, in fact, constitutes the fulcrum of <lb/>the debate which the decision in Novartis attracts, in case after case. <lb/>To the extent relevant, paras 114 and 116 of the report may, therefore, <lb/>be reproduced as under: <lb/>&quot;114. Mr Andhyarujina and Mr Gopal Subramanium, learned <lb/>Senior Advocates appearing for the appellant, strenuously <lb/>argued that the patent information furnished by the appellant <lb/>before the US FDA, or its patent term extension application, <lb/>or the legal notice given at its behest to NATCO Pharma Ltd. <lb/>should not be construed to mean that Imatinib Mesylate was <lb/>anticipated in the Zimmermann Patent. Mr Andhyarujina <lb/>submitted that the Zimmermann Patent did not disclose <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate. That the Zimmermann Patent did not <lb/>describe any working method for converting Imatinib to <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate. It only stated that a salt may be formed by <lb/>acid without disclosing any method, but simply calling the <lb/>method to be &quot;per se&quot;. The Zimmermann Patent mentioned <lb/>multiple choices of compounds including Imatinib free base <lb/>but not any salt of any compound, much less Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate. Mr Andhyarujina further submitted that it is well <lb/>settled that the disclosure of an invention must be in a manner <lb/>clear enough and complete enough for the invention to be <lb/>performed by a person skilled in the art (Terrell on Law of <lb/>Patents, 16th Edn., p. 51, Para 3.2/7). The learned counsel <lb/>further submitted that there was a difference between that <lb/>which is covered and that which is disclosed. Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate is covered by the Zimmermann Patent but <lb/>not disclosed therein. <lb/>***** <lb/>116. Mr Subramanium further submitted that the scope <lb/>of coverage is distinct from the scope of disclosure in a <lb/>patent. Imatinib Mesylate could be said to be not new and <lb/>known from the Zimmermann Patent only in case there was a <lb/>complete disclosure of the method of its preparation in the <lb/></body>

			<body>Zimmermann Patent. The learned counsel strongly contended <lb/>that coverage under a patent of the Markush kind cannot lead <lb/>to any presumption of disclosure, much less any enabling <lb/>disclosure of all the compounds within the genus. The learned <lb/>counsel further contended that coverage that is granted in <lb/>respect of a patent is not always coextensive with what <lb/>is disclosed in that patent. In certain circumstances, where it <lb/>is a pioneering invention (as in the case of the Zimmermann <lb/>invention), the patent may be entitled to larger coverage than <lb/>what is specifically disclosed in it. The learned counsel <lb/>argued that coverage cannot be used to presume an enabling <lb/>disclosure of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate in <lb/>the Zimmermann Patent. Disclosure in a specification can <lb/>never be presumed, and that is a question of the clear teaching <lb/>contained in the specification. The teaching of a patent lies in <lb/>the disclosure/specification that <lb/>supports <lb/>the <lb/>claim. <lb/>The disclosure describes the invention. The claim defines <lb/>through language the various ways the invention could be <lb/>used i.e. possible but not actualised products. This is the <lb/>scope of protection granted under the patent. For the purpose <lb/>of prior art, it is the disclosure in the specification supporting <lb/>the claim and not the written description or the claims <lb/>themselves, that must be assessed. The claim can never be the <lb/>teaching. He further contended that it would be wrong to say <lb/>that the appellant&apos;s claims for β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate is a case of double or repeat patenting, that is, the <lb/>same invention is being sought to be patented twice. The <lb/>claim for patent for β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate <lb/>relates to a second and different invention. Though the <lb/>invention in the first part (Imatinib) may be necessary to <lb/>arrive at the invention in the second part, the final product <lb/>does not come into existence without inventions. The <lb/>principle is that if a product is covered, it means that it <lb/>infringes a patent. Whether the patent infringed disclosed <lb/>every aspect of the product in its specification is a separate <lb/>inquiry.&quot; <lb/>(Italics in original, underscoring supplied) <lb/>This submission is noted, yet again -thereby emphasizing its <lb/>importance to the entire dispute -in para 125, in which the Supreme <lb/>Court again records the submission, of Mr Andhyarujina and Mr <lb/></body>

			<body>Subramanium, on behalf of Novartis, &quot;that the coverage or the claim <lb/>and the disclosure or the teaching, had different parameters in a <lb/>patent, and that the former may have extended boundary within which <lb/>disclosure or teaching may be confined to a narrow extent&quot; (with the <lb/>italics provided by the Supreme Court itself, in the judgement). <lb/>11.15.17 <lb/>Novartis, therefore, sought to distinguish, in its <lb/>submissions before the Supreme Court, between &quot;coverage&quot; and <lb/>&quot;disclosure&quot;, in a patent specification. Even while admitting, in so <lb/>many words, that Imatinib Mesylate was covered by the Zimmerman <lb/>Patent, Novartis nevertheless asserted that Imatinib Mesylate was not <lb/>disclosed by the Zimmerman Patent. Disclosure, it was sought to be <lb/>submitted, was required to be &quot;in a manner clear enough and complete <lb/>enough for the invention to be performed by a person skilled in the <lb/>art&quot;. Complete disclosure would also require disclosure of the method <lb/>of preparation of the compound, i.e. the disclosure had to be <lb/>&quot;enabling&quot; in character. It was contended that the Zimmerman Patent, <lb/>while mentioning multiple choices of compounds, including the <lb/>Imatinib free base (and, therefore, being in the nature of a &quot;Markush&quot; <lb/>patent), did not refer to any salt of any compound, much less Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate. Nor was the method for arriving at the salt, from the <lb/>Markush moiety, disclosed. <lb/>Though, therefore, Imatinib was <lb/>necessary to arrive at Imatinib Mesylate, the process was &quot;inventive&quot; <lb/>in nature. The idea was sought to be expressed, otherwise, by <lb/>distinguishing between the &quot;boundary&quot; of the Zimmerman Patent and <lb/>the &quot;enablement&quot; or &quot;disclosure&quot; therein. Though the boundary of the <lb/></body>

			<body>Zimmerman Patent extended up to Imatinib Mesylate, Novartis <lb/>contended that the Zimmerman Patent did not, nevertheless, disclose <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate, in an enabling fashion. <lb/>11.15.18 <lb/>Dealing with the submissions, the Supreme Court held, in <lb/>para 118 and 119 of its decision, thus: <lb/>&quot;118. The submissions of Mr Andhyarujina and Mr <lb/>Subramanium are based on making a distinction between <lb/>the coverage or claim in a patent and the disclosure made <lb/>therein. The submissions on behalf of the appellant can be <lb/>summed up by saying that the boundary laid out by the claim <lb/>for coverage is permissible to be much wider than <lb/>the disclosure/enablement/teaching in a patent. <lb/>119. The dichotomy that is sought to be drawn <lb/>between coverage or <lb/>claim <lb/>on <lb/>the <lb/>one <lb/>hand <lb/>and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on the <lb/>other hand, seems to strike at the very root of the rationale of <lb/>the law of patent. Under the scheme of patent, a monopoly is <lb/>granted to a private individual in exchange of the invention <lb/>being made public so that, at the end of the patent term, the <lb/>invention may belong to the people at large who may be <lb/>benefited by it. To say that the coverage in a patent might go <lb/>much beyond the disclosure thus seem to negate the <lb/>fundamental rule underlying the grant of patents.&quot; <lb/>(Italics in original; underscoring supplied) <lb/>11.15.19 <lb/>Considerable reliance was placed, by learned Senior <lb/>Counsel for Novartis in the Supreme Court, on the decision of the <lb/>United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals in In re. Hogan 34 , <lb/>to support the contention &quot;that the Zimmerman Patent is a patent <lb/>covering a genus with certain known species, and many other species <lb/></body>

			<body>that were unknown at that time, but which are equally covered by the <lb/>patent, even though there is no enabling disclosure in the patent in <lb/>respect thereof&quot;. It is not necessary to refer to Hogan 34 in any great <lb/>detail, as (in para 133 of the report), the Supreme Court held the said <lb/>decision not to be applicable to the facts of the case before it. Having <lb/>noted the above reliance, by learned Senior Counsel for Novartis on <lb/>Hogan 34 , the Supreme Court reiterated its finding that &quot;Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate is a known substance from the Zimmerman Patent&quot;. As <lb/>such, the Supreme Court found Hogan 34 , which dealt with the issue of <lb/>whether species which were unknown at the time of the original <lb/>patent, could be covered thereby, in the absence of an enabling <lb/>disclosure, not to be relevant to the facts before it. Having so noted, <lb/>the Supreme Court went on to hold, in para-134 of the report, thus: <lb/>&quot;However, before leaving Hogan and proceeding further, we <lb/>would like to say that in this country the law of patent, after <lb/>the introduction of product patent for all kinds of substances <lb/>in the patent regime, is in its infancy. We certainly do not <lb/>wish the law of patent in this country to develop on lines <lb/>where there may be a vast gap between the coverage and <lb/>the disclosure under the patent; where the scope of the patent <lb/>is determined not on the intrinsic worth of the invention but <lb/>by the artful drafting of its claims by skilful lawyers, and <lb/>where patents are traded as a commodity not for production <lb/>and marketing of the patented products but to search for <lb/>someone who may be sued for infringement of the patent.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>11.15.20 <lb/>The Supreme Court, therefore (in para-135 of the report) <lb/>held, in terms, that Imatinib Mesylate did not qualify the test of <lb/>&quot;invention&quot;, as contained in clauses (j) and (ja) of Section 2(1) of the <lb/>Patents Act. <lb/></body>

			<body>11.15.21 <lb/>Having so held, the Supreme Court went on to examine <lb/>whether the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was patentable, as <lb/>contended by Novartis. This issue, the Supreme Court observed, <lb/>directly brought into play Section 3(d) of the Patents Act. Novartis, <lb/>through learned Senior Counsel, advanced, at this stage, yet another <lb/>ground to contest the applicability of Section 3(d). It was submitted <lb/>that Section 3(d) applied only to new forms of a known substance <lb/>having a known efficacy. Stress was laid on the expression &quot;known&quot;, <lb/>to submit that it could not be equated with &quot;conceivable&quot;. &quot;Known&quot;, <lb/>it was submitted, indicated that the substance, as well as its efficacy, <lb/>had to be proven and well-established, empirically and beyond doubt. <lb/>Novartis submitted that neither Imatinib nor Imatinib Mesylate had <lb/>any known efficacy, so that the requirement of establishing that the β-<lb/>crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate had enhanced efficacy over <lb/>Imatinib or Imatinib Mesylate, could not arise at all. The Supreme <lb/>Court rejected (in para 137 of the report) the interpretation suggested, <lb/>by Novartis, of the expression &quot;known&quot;, as contained in Section 3(d), <lb/>vis-à-vis the concept of &quot;efficacy&quot;. Citing, for the purpose, the <lb/>precedent in Monsanto Co. v. Coromandal Indag Products (P) Ltd 35 <lb/>(which interpreted the expression &quot;publicly known&quot;, as employed in <lb/>Section 64(1)(e) and (f) of the Patents Act), the Supreme Court <lb/>observed that, apart from the finding, already returned by it, that <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate was a known substance from the Zimmerman <lb/>patent, the NDA submitted by Novartis to the US FDA clearly stated <lb/></body>

			<body>that Imatinib Mesylate had undergone extensive preclinical, technical <lb/>and clinical research, along with the details thereof. The efficacy of <lb/>Imatinib, therefore, it was held, was equally known and evident from <lb/>the Zimmerman Patent. Per sequitur, it was held that the β-crystalline <lb/>form of Imatinib Mesylate was, clearly, a new form of a known <lb/>substance, i.e. Imatinib Mesylate, with known efficacy. <lb/>11.15.22 <lb/>The fallout, observed the Supreme Court, was that, in <lb/>order for it to be patentable, the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate had necessarily to satisfy the tests contained in the <lb/>substantive Section 3(d) as well as the Explanation thereto. <lb/>11.15.23 <lb/>The Supreme Court advanced the following reasons, for <lb/>rejecting the plea of Novartis that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate had enhanced efficacy, vis-à-vis Imatinib, or even vis-à-vis <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate per se: <lb/>(i) <lb/>The patent application filed by Novartis specifically <lb/>acknowledged that &quot;all the indicated inhibitory and <lb/>pharmacological effects&quot; of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate &quot;are also found with the free base … or other cells <lb/>thereof&quot;. There could, therefore, be no question of the β-<lb/>crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate having any enhanced <lb/>efficacy over the known substance (Imatinib/Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate), of which it was a new form. <lb/></body>

			<body>(ii) Though there was some degree of ambivalence on this <lb/>aspect, the application for grant of patent, filed by Novartis, <lb/>conveyed the impression that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate was derived directly from the Imatinib free base. <lb/>Apropos the claimed &quot;enhanced efficacy&quot; of the β-crystalline <lb/>form of Imatinib Mesylate, vis-à-vis the free base Imatinib, two <lb/>affidavits, by Paul William Manley and Giorgio Pietro <lb/>Massimini, were filed by Novartis. Relevant passages, from the <lb/>said affidavits, were reproduced by the Supreme Court in paras <lb/>147 and 148 of the report, which read thus: <lb/>&quot;147. Manley, in Para 8 of his affidavit, stated: <lb/>&quot;The physical properties of the free base and <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate differ in that the free base is <lb/>only very slightly soluble in water (0.001 g/100 <lb/>ml) while Imatinib Mesylate is very soluble in <lb/>water (β-crystalline form: 130 g/100 ml). Other <lb/>physical characteristics of the subject <lb/>compound are described at pp. 2-3 of the <lb/>specification. The attendant advantages because <lb/>of these properties are also simultaneously <lb/>described therein. These characteristics and <lb/>hence the attendant properties/advantages are <lb/>not shared by the free base. Furthermore, the β <lb/>form significantly differs from the alpha form: <lb/>Physical attributes: <lb/>(a) <lb/>The beta crystal form has substantially <lb/>more beneficial flow properties and thus results <lb/>in better processability than the alpha crystal <lb/>form. <lb/>(b) <lb/>The beta crystal form of the <lb/>methanesulfonic acid addition salt is the <lb/>thermodynamically more stable form at room <lb/></body>

			<note place="headnote">CS(COMM) 69/2021 &amp; CS(COMM) 611/2019 <lb/></note>

			<page>Page 91 of 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>temperature. Greater stability is thus to be <lb/>expected. <lb/>(c) <lb/>The beta crystal form is less hygroscopic <lb/>than the alpha crystal form of the <lb/>methanesulfonic acid addition salt of a <lb/>compound of Formula I. <lb/>(d) <lb/>The lower hygroscopicity is a further <lb/>advantage for processing and storing the acid <lb/>addition salt in the beta crystal form.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>148. Massimini, in Para 9 of his affidavit stated: <lb/>&quot;A study conducted on rats provided statistical <lb/>evidence for a difference in the relative <lb/>bioavailability of the free base and Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate in the beta crystalline form. In such <lb/>study, a mean AUC (0-48h) value of 264.000 <lb/>h*ng/mL was found for the free base compared <lb/>with a mean AUC (0-48h) value of 344000 <lb/>h*ng/mL for Imatinib Mesylate having the β-<lb/>crystal form. In other words, an about 30% <lb/>improvement in bioavailability was observed <lb/>for the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate <lb/>compared to the free base. The test results are <lb/>attached herewith as Annexure &apos;A&apos;.&quot; <lb/>(iii) These affidavits compared the β-crystalline form of <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate with the free base Imatinib. That, however, <lb/>was insufficient, as the declaration, in the application for grant <lb/>of patent filed by Novartis, as well as in the affidavits, that the <lb/>β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was derived from <lb/>Imatinib in free base form, was based on the premise that the <lb/>Zimmerman Patent extended only to free base Imatinib and did <lb/></body>

			<body>not cover Imatinib Mesylate. This had already been found to be <lb/>incorrect, in the judgement. That apart, before the Supreme <lb/>Court, Novartis contended that two stages were involved in <lb/>processing from the free base Imatinib to the β-crystalline form <lb/>of Imatinib Mesylate, in which the substance immediately <lb/>preceding the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate was the <lb/>non-crystalline Imatinib Mesylate. Novartis had, therefore, <lb/>necessarily to establish enhanced efficacy of the β-crystalline <lb/>form of Imatinib Mesylate over the non-crystalline Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate. No material, whatsoever had, however, been filed by <lb/>Novartis on this aspect. <lb/>(iv) Insofar as the higher solubility, attributed to the β-<lb/>crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate in the affidavits filed by <lb/>Novartis, was concerned, that might, quite possibly, had been a <lb/>property of Imatinib Mesylate itself, as it was a well-known fact <lb/>that salts were more soluble than compounds in free base form. <lb/>If solubility were to be excluded, the &quot;additional&quot; properties <lb/>possessed by the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, were <lb/>(i) more beneficial flow properties, (ii) better thermodynamic <lb/>stability and (iii) lower hygroscopicity. <lb/>(v) These additional properties, however, did not amount to <lb/>enhanced efficacy of the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate, even vis-à-vis the free base Imatinib. Noting the fact <lb/>that Novartis has already acknowledged the possession, by the <lb/></body>

			<body>free base Imatinib, of all the pharmacological effects of the β-<lb/>crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, the Supreme Court went <lb/>on to deal with an additional submission, advanced by Novartis, <lb/>to the effect that the free base Imatinib had little or no <lb/>solubility. This, contended Novartis, rendered the free base <lb/>Imatinib incapable of administration as a drug to human beings, <lb/>as it would &quot;sit in the stomach like a brick and would pass out <lb/>with no therapeutic effect&quot;. The methanesulfonic acid addition <lb/>salt of Imatinib made the therapeutic ingredient of the <lb/>compound, which was Imatinib, much more highly soluble and, <lb/>consequently, suitable for administration as a drug to human <lb/>beings. These properties, contended Novartis, were enhanced <lb/>in the β-crystalline form which, therefore, was even more <lb/>suitable for administration as a drug than Imatinib Mesylate. <lb/>Novartis contended that this amounted to &quot;enhanced efficacy&quot;. <lb/>(vi) Dealing with this contention, the Supreme Court, in paras <lb/>157 and 158 of the report, explained, in detail, what &quot;efficacy&quot;, <lb/>in the context of Section 3(d) of the Patents Act, meant. These <lb/>paras read as under: <lb/>&quot;157. What is &quot;efficacy&quot;? &quot;Efficacy&quot; means &quot;the <lb/>ability to produce a desired or intended result&quot; [The <lb/>New Oxford Dictionary of English, Edn. 1998.]. <lb/>Hence, the test of efficacy in the context of Section <lb/>3(d) would be different, depending upon the result the <lb/>product under consideration is desired or intended to <lb/>produce. In other words, the test of efficacy would <lb/>depend upon the function, utility or the purpose of the <lb/>product under consideration. Therefore, in the case of <lb/>a medicine that claims to cure a disease, the test of <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 94 of 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>efficacy can only be &quot;therapeutic efficacy&quot;. The <lb/>question then arises, what would be the parameter of <lb/>therapeutic efficacy and what are the advantages and <lb/>benefits that may be taken into account for <lb/>determining the enhancement of therapeutic efficacy? <lb/>With regard to the genesis of Section 3(d), and more <lb/>particularly the circumstances in which Section 3(d) <lb/>was amended to make it even more constrictive than <lb/>before, we have no doubt that the &quot;therapeutic <lb/>efficacy&quot; of a medicine must be judged strictly and <lb/>narrowly. Our inference that the test of enhanced <lb/>efficacy in case of chemical substances, especially <lb/>medicine, should receive a narrow and strict <lb/>interpretation is based not only on external factors but <lb/>there is sufficient internal evidence that leads to the <lb/>same view. It may be noted that the text added to <lb/>Section 3(d) by the 2005 Amendment lays down the <lb/>condition of &quot;enhancement of the known efficacy&quot;. <lb/>Further, the Explanation requires the derivative to <lb/>&quot;differ significantly in properties with regard to <lb/>efficacy&quot;. What is evident, therefore, is that not all <lb/>advantageous or beneficial properties are relevant, but <lb/>only such properties that directly relate to efficacy, <lb/>which in case of medicine, as seen above, is its <lb/>therapeutic efficacy. <lb/>158. While dealing with the Explanation it must also <lb/>be kept in mind that each of the different forms <lb/>mentioned in the Explanation have some properties <lb/>inherent to that form e.g. solubility to a salt and <lb/>hygroscopicity to a polymorph. These forms, unless <lb/>they differ significantly in property with regard to <lb/>efficacy, are expressly excluded from the definition of <lb/>&quot;invention&quot;. Hence, the mere change of form with <lb/>properties inherent to that form would not qualify as <lb/>&quot;enhancement of efficacy&quot; of a known substance. In <lb/>other words, the Explanation is meant to indicate what <lb/>is not to be considered as therapeutic efficacy.&quot; <lb/>(Italics in original; underscoring supplied) <lb/></body>

			<body>&quot;Efficacy&quot;, when applied to a pharmaceutical product in the <lb/>context of Section 3(d) of the Patents Act has, therefore, <lb/>necessarily to be &quot;therapeutic efficacy&quot;. The product must, <lb/>therefore, demonstrate &quot;enhanced therapeutic efficacy&quot;, if it is <lb/>one to which Section 3(d) is otherwise attracted. &quot;Therapeutic <lb/>efficacy&quot; cannot, additionally, relates to properties already <lb/>possessed by the &quot;known substance&quot;, as was made apparent by <lb/>the Explanation to Section 3(d). <lb/>(vii) Viewed thus, more beneficial flow properties, better <lb/>thermodynamic stability and lower hygroscopicity could not be <lb/>regarded as enhancing the &quot;therapeutic efficacy&quot; of the β-<lb/>crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, over the free base <lb/>Imatinib or over the non-crystalline Imatinib Mesylate. <lb/>(viii) Novartis, however, also pleaded that the β-crystalline <lb/>form of Imatinib Mesylate possessed &quot;30% increased <lb/>bioavailability&quot;, as compared to the free base Imatinib. In this <lb/>context, the Supreme Court relied on an article titled <lb/>&quot;Appropriateness of Bioavailability and Bioequivalency as Pre-<lb/>Market Clearance Considerations&quot; by Jane Moffitt 36 , which <lb/>opined that &quot;a determination that the drug product is <lb/>bioavailable is not in itself a determination of effectiveness&quot;. <lb/>Even otherwise, the Supreme Court observed that mere <lb/>increased bioavailability would not necessarily lead to <lb/></body>

No material, to that <lb/>effect, it was noted, was forthcoming before the Supreme Court <lb/>&quot;to indicate that the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate <lb/>will produce an enhanced or superior efficacy (therapeutic) on <lb/>molecular basis than what could be achieved with Imatinib free <lb/>base in vivo animal model&quot;. <lb/>Thus, held the Supreme Court, the β-crystalline form of Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate had failed the Section 3(d) test. <lb/>11.15.24 <lb/>Even while so holding, the Supreme Court went on to <lb/>clarify, ex abundanti cautela, in paras 168 and 169 of the report, that <lb/>Section 3(d), and the requirement of establishing enhanced therapeutic <lb/>efficacy, applied only where the product, for which patent protection <lb/>was sought, was a new form of a known substance with known <lb/>efficacy. In all other cases, what applied was Section 2(1)(j) (which <lb/>defined &quot;invention&quot;) which, in the case of chemicals and <lb/>pharmaceuticals, did not necessarily require the product of the <lb/>applicant to be something altogether new, unfamiliar, strange or not <lb/>existing before. It could also &quot;mean something &quot;different from a <lb/>recent previous&quot; or &quot;one regarded as better than what went before&quot; or <lb/>&quot;in addition to another or others of the same kind&quot; &quot; 37 . <lb/></body>

			<body>11.15.25 <lb/>As a concluding observation, the Supreme Court took <lb/>note of the fact that Imatinib Mesylate, in its non-crystalline form, had <lb/>been marketed since 2001 as Gleevec and that, consequent to grant of <lb/>exclusive marketing rights on 10 th November, 2003, Novartis was <lb/>marketing Gleevec in India as well. The package, wherein Gleevec <lb/>was sold, described the drug as &quot;Imatinib Mesylate Tablets 100 mg&quot;, <lb/>and further declared that &quot;each film-coated tablet contains 100 mg <lb/>Imatinib (as Mesylate)&quot;. There was no reference, on the package, to <lb/>the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate. What was being sold by <lb/>Novartis, therefore, it was observed, was not the β-crystalline form of <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate, but Imatinib Mesylate per se. This additional fact <lb/>portrayed the case of Novartis, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, <lb/>&quot;in rather poor light&quot;, and revealed that the patent claim of Novartis, <lb/>for the β-crystalline form of Imatinib Mesylate, was only an attempt <lb/>to obtain a patent for Imatinib Mesylate which, otherwise, was not <lb/>permissible in India. <lb/>11.16 <lb/>Before proceeding to assess the effect, if any, on the <lb/>present dispute, of Novartis 17 , it is necessary to deal with the <lb/>contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that, in paras 23 to 27 of the plaint and <lb/>in paras 14 to 15 of the replication, the plaintiff has admitted coverage <lb/>of CTPR by Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. Paras 23 to 27 of the plaint and <lb/>Paras 14 and 15 of the replication read as under: <lb/>Paras 23 to 27 of the plaint <lb/>&quot;23.

An exemplary list of such <lb/>patents granted in India include: IN 204978, IN213177, <lb/>IN205622, IN215218, IN298645, IN261551, IN284017, <lb/>IN252356 and IN261276. <lb/>24. <lb/>It would be pertinent to mention that the Plaintiffs&apos; <lb/>patent IN 204978 (IN &apos;978) mentioned in paragraph 23 is a <lb/>granted and subsisting genus patent covering a vast number of <lb/>compounds of a class of anthranilamides. The compounds of <lb/>Formula 1 of the suit patent are a novel and inventive <lb/>selection <lb/>from <lb/>the <lb/>disclosure <lb/>of <lb/>IN <lb/>&apos;978. <lb/>CHLORANTRANILIPROLE (CTPR) is not specifically <lb/>disclosed in the genus patent IN &apos;978, although it is within the <lb/>scope of the numerous compounds included in the Markush <lb/>Formula disclosed and claimed in the patent. A person skilled <lb/>in the art would not have recognized CTPR from the genus <lb/>patent. <lb/>25. <lb/>In fact during the prosecution of the application <lb/>corresponding to the suit, patent IN 201307 in the US, a <lb/>Declaration was filed at the United States Patent and <lb/>Trademarks Office (USPTO) comparing compounds <lb/>disclosed in the suit patent with the closest, specifically <lb/>disclosed compounds in IN &apos;978. A copy of the said <lb/>declaration is annexed with the list of documents filed with <lb/>the present plaint. <lb/>26. <lb/>The said Declaration mentions tests conducted with the <lb/>compounds of the selection invention (i.e. suit patent IN &apos;307) <lb/>and a comparison with the closest compounds disclosed in IN <lb/>&apos;978. In the tests, all the new compounds of the suit patent (IN <lb/>&apos;307) showed unexpected and unpredictable superior <lb/>insecticidal activity compared with the closest compounds <lb/>disclosed in IN &apos;978. CTPR is not specifically disclosed in IN <lb/>&apos;978. A person skilled in the art would not arrive at CTPR <lb/>from Formula 1 of IN &apos;978 without human intervention and <lb/>ingenuity on account of extensive, thorough and undue <lb/>experimentation or hindsight knowledge. Nonetheless, CTPR <lb/>is in the class of anthranilamides within the scope of the <lb/>numerous compounds included in the Markush Formula <lb/>disclosed and claimed in the IN &apos;978 patent. <lb/></body>

The suit patent specifically discloses and claims CTPR <lb/>by way of a chemical structure and/or specific chemical <lb/>name. One of the main defenses taken by the Defendant <lb/>herein is that CTPR is disclosed and claimed by a previous <lb/>India patent IN &apos;978 and that therefore IN &apos;307 is an invalidly <lb/>granted patent. This contention of the Defendant is false and <lb/>misleading since to qualify as a disclosure in a prior <lb/>publication, the invention, i.e. the compound CTPR in this <lb/>case, has to be specifically and particularly disclosed in the <lb/>prior art either by way of a chemical structure, or a specific <lb/>Chemical/IUPAC name. <lb/>15. <lb/>The Plaintiffs also submit the following: <lb/>i. <lb/>The compounds of formula I of IN&apos;307 are a <lb/>novel and inventive selection from the disclosure of <lb/>IN&apos;978. All of the compounds of the suit patent <lb/>(IN&apos;307) contain a 3-substituted-2-pyridyl ring and <lb/>two substituents (R1 and R2) on the phenyl ring. After <lb/>tedious and painstaking research, it was found that this <lb/>combination of groups leads to compounds with <lb/>unexpected superior insecticidal activity compared to <lb/>other insecticidal anthranilamides disclosed in IN&apos;978. <lb/>ii. <lb/>In fact during the prosecution of the patent <lb/>application corresponding to the suit patent IN 201307 <lb/>in the US, a Declaration was filed at the United States <lb/>Patent and Trademarks Office (USPTO) comparing <lb/>compounds disclosed in the said patent application <lb/>with the closest, specifically disclosed compounds in <lb/>the US equivalent of IN&apos;978.

In the tests, all the new <lb/>compounds of the suit patent (IN&apos;307) showed <lb/>unexpected and unpredictable superior insecticidal <lb/>activity compared with the closest compounds <lb/>disclosed in IN&apos;978. <lb/>iii. <lb/>Further, the Indian Patents Office has granted <lb/>the suit patent after a thorough examination and after <lb/>being duly satisfied regarding the novelty and <lb/>inventiveness and patentability of the invention <lb/>disclosed in IN&apos;307 over IN&apos;978. Moreover, there had <lb/>been no pre-grant opposition or post grant opposition <lb/>or a revocation proceeding filed against the suit patent <lb/>till the filing of the present suit.&quot; <lb/>11.17 Paras 23 to 27 of the plaint and paras 14 and 15 of the <lb/>replication, as extracted hereinabove, do not reveal any admission, on <lb/>the part of the plaintiff, that CTPR is covered by Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. <lb/>What the plaintiff has contended is that CTPR is &quot;within the scope&quot; of <lb/>the class of anthranilamides covered by the Markush formula <lb/>disclosed in Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. There is, therefore, no admission, by <lb/>the plaintiff, either of coverage, or of disclosure, of CTPR in Claim 22 <lb/>of IN&apos;978. <lb/>11.18 The &quot;coverage versus disclosure&quot; conundrum, in the light of <lb/>Novartis 17 <lb/>11.18.1 <lb/>Considerable debate was generated, at the Bar, on the <lb/>exact scope of import of paras 119 and 134 of Novartis 17 , specifically <lb/>with respect to the following three observations/findings, to be found <lb/>therein: <lb/></body>

			<body>Mr. Sethi also sought to distinguish the decision on other parameters, <lb/>already noted hereinbefore. In order to examine the correctness of <lb/>Mr. Sethi&apos;s submissions, it would be required, in the first instance, to <lb/>understand what exactly the Supreme Court held, on the aspect of <lb/>coverage vis-à-vis disclosure in the patent and, in the second, to assess <lb/>whether the applicability, of the law enunciated by the Supreme Court <lb/>in this regard, was compromised in view of the factual distinctions <lb/>highlighted by Mr. Sethi. <lb/>11.18.4 <lb/>It is true, as held by the Supreme Court itself, that <lb/>propositions enunciated by courts, in judicial decisions, are not to be <lb/>likened to Euclid&apos;s theorems 38 . It is equally true that, ordinarily, the <lb/>enunciation of the law by the Supreme Court is to be appreciated in <lb/>the light of the factual and contextual backdrop in which the <lb/>enunciation took place. 39 Equally true is it, however, that, where the <lb/>Supreme Court enunciates or expounds the law in general or omnibus <lb/>terms, clearly intended to be applicable even beyond the peripheries <lb/>of the controversy before it, Courts, hierarchically below the Supreme <lb/>Court, would be well advised not to limit, or their own accord, such <lb/>declaration of the law, to the facts which were before the Supreme <lb/>Court.

			<body>11.18.5 <lb/>Paras 118, 119 and 134 of the decision in Novartis 17 <lb/>have, in my view, to be understood in the light of paras 114 and 116, <lb/>which set out the submissions advanced, before the Supreme Court, <lb/>by learned Senior Counsel Mr. Subramanium and Mr. Andhiyarujina. <lb/>Though the submissions of learned Senior Counsel were, as they <lb/>necessarily had to be, advanced in the light of the factual controversy <lb/>before the Supreme Court, the propositions advanced were general in <lb/>nature, and the findings of the Supreme Court, as contained in paras <lb/>118, 119 and 134 also, in my opinion, equally omnibus. What was <lb/>contended, by learned Senior Counsel, as recorded in paras 114 and <lb/>116 of the report, was that &quot;the scope of coverage is distinct from the <lb/>scope of disclosure in a patent&quot;. This argument stands reiterated, in <lb/>the same para (para 116) -&quot;that coverage that is granted in respect of <lb/>a patent is not always co-extensive with what is disclosed in the <lb/>patent&quot;. In the light of the Zimmerman invention, learned Senior <lb/>Counsel contended that &quot;the patent may be entitled to larger coverage <lb/>than what is specifically disclosed in it&quot;. The teaching in the patent, it <lb/>was contended, lay &quot;in the disclosure/specification that supports the <lb/>claim&quot;, which &quot;describes the invention&quot;. <lb/>Dealing with these <lb/>submissions, the Supreme Court held, in para 119 of the report, that <lb/>&quot;the dichotomy… sought to be drawn between coverage or claim on <lb/>the one hand and disclosure or enablement or teaching in a patent on <lb/>the other hand, (seemed) to strike at the very root of the rationale of <lb/>the law of patent&quot;.

			<body>the suit patent before it. In fact, a bare reading of para 118 of the <lb/>report in Novartis 17 makes it clear that the Supreme Court has <lb/>expressed its view with respect to patents in general. The opening <lb/>sentence of para 119 of the report is a proposition couched in absolute <lb/>terms and, in my respectful opinion, it would be folly, on the part of <lb/>this Court, to restrict those observations to the facts of Novartis 17 . <lb/>According to the Supreme Court (and at the cost of repetition), any <lb/>dichotomy, sought to be drawn between coverage or claim, and <lb/>disclosure or enablement or teaching, in a patent, struck at the very <lb/>root of the rationale of patent law. Obviously, the Supreme Court has <lb/>disapproved, in no uncertain terms, of any dichotomy being sought to <lb/>be drawn between coverage and disclosure. <lb/>11.18.6 <lb/>Having said that, etymologically, &quot;dichotomy&quot; is not the <lb/>same as &quot;distinction&quot;. The Supreme Court has not held that coverage <lb/>and disclosure are the same. Nor has it held that there is no <lb/>distinction between coverage and disclosure. Choosing its words with <lb/>precision, the Supreme Court has held that there is no &quot;dichotomy&quot; <lb/>between &quot;coverage&quot; and disclosure&quot;. &quot;Dichotomy&quot; is defined, in the <lb/>Oxford Dictionary, as &quot;a division or contrast between two things that <lb/>are or are being represented as being opposed or entirely different&quot;. <lb/>In holding that there can be no dichotomy between coverage or claim, <lb/>on the one hand, and disclosure or enablement or teaching, on the <lb/>other, the Supreme Court has not, therefore, held that they are <lb/>identical. Accepting the submission of Mr. Sai Deepak would require <lb/>this Court to place, in the first sentence in para 119 of the report in <lb/></body>

			<body>Novartis 17 , the word &quot;dichotomy&quot; with &quot;distinction&quot; or &quot;difference&quot;. <lb/>That, I am afraid, I cannot do. Apparently, in fact, the Supreme Court <lb/>has, in disapproving the existence of any &quot;wide gap&quot; between <lb/>coverage and disclosure, clarified that it merely disapproved of any <lb/>dichotomy between these concepts, and was not seeking to hold that <lb/>the concepts were identical. <lb/>11.18.7 <lb/>Indeed, the judgement of the Supreme Court, read thus, <lb/>would be in entire accord with the covenants of the Patents Act, which <lb/>make repeated reference, in more than one provision, to <lb/>&quot;disclosure&quot; 40 . Clearly, the framers of the Patents Act did not <lb/>envisage the &quot;claim&quot; or &quot;coverage&quot; of the claim, to be identical to <lb/>&quot;disclosure&quot;. Nor, for that matter, has the Supreme Court so held. <lb/>What was being sought to be contended, before the Supreme Court, <lb/>by learned Senior Counsel was that, though the specific claim in the <lb/>Zimmerman patent covered Imatinib with its pharmaceutically <lb/>acceptable salts, and though Imatinib Mesylate was a <lb/>pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib and, therefore, covered <lb/>by the Zimmerman Patent, it was, nevertheless, not disclosed by it. <lb/>Such an argument, if accepted, would amount to holding that there <lb/>was complete dichotomy between &quot;coverage&quot; and &quot;disclosure&quot;, with <lb/>no connection between the two. It would amount to holding that, <lb/>while examining what was disclosed in a patent, the authority, or the <lb/>Court concerned, was to remain oblivious to the coverage of the <lb/>patent. Such a dichotomy, which would result in a &quot;wide gap&quot; <lb/>40 Refer, for instance, to Section 10(4), 11(2), (3), (3A) and (4), 16, 33(2), 54(1), 59(1), 64(1)(h), (i), (m) and <lb/>(p), among others. <lb/></body>

			<body>between coverage and disclosure was, in terms, disapproved by the <lb/>Supreme Court. If, however, there was clear coverage of a product in <lb/>the claim (as was found to exist in the Zimmerman Patent, qua <lb/>Imatinib Mesylate), it would be difficult for the patent holder to <lb/>assert, before the Court, that, despite such coverage, the claim did not <lb/>disclose the product. That, in my view, is what Novartis 17 holds. It <lb/>does not pronounce that coverage and disclosure are identical or <lb/>synonymous terms, in patent law. The submission, by Mr. Sai <lb/>Deepak, to that effect cannot, therefore, be accepted. <lb/>11.18.8 <lb/>Proceeding from this premise, the Supreme Court went <lb/>on to hold that, as Imatinib, with its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, <lb/>stood claimed in the Zimmerman patent, and as Imatinib Mesylate <lb/>was a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of Imatinib, it was also <lb/>claimed in the Zimmerman Patent. It was not open, therefore, to the <lb/>appellants before the Supreme Court to contend that, though Imatinib <lb/>Mesylate was claimed/covered by the Zimmerman Patent, it was not <lb/>disclosed thereby. This would amount to creating a complete divide -<lb/>or dichotomy -between coverage, or claim, and disclosure which, <lb/>according to the Supreme Court, was not permissible. In other words, <lb/>something which is specifically claimed or covered by the specific <lb/>claim cannot be disowned by asserting that it was not disclosed. <lb/>11.18.9 <lb/>To that extent, the interpretation, of Novartis 17 , as <lb/>advanced by Mr Sai Deepak, commends itself to acceptance. <lb/></body>

			<body>11.18.10 <lb/>Where, however, Novartis 17 fails to come to the aid of <lb/>the defendant in the present case, is the point of distinction where, <lb/>unlike the circumstances which obtained before the Supreme Court, <lb/>there is, in the present case, no claim, no coverage and no disclosure, <lb/>by the plaintiff, of CTPR in the genus patent, i.e. Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, <lb/>as I have already opined hereinabove. No question of any dichotomy <lb/>between claim and disclosure, therefore, arises in the present case. <lb/>11.19 Novartis 17 cannot, therefore, assist the case of the defendant. <lb/>11.20 The defendant, in its written statement, asserts, in para 93, that <lb/>the patents IN&apos;978 (the genus patent in the present case), US patent <lb/>5998424 (US&apos;424), US Patent 6020357 (US&apos;357), PCT International <lb/>Publication WO 01/70671 (WO&apos;671), European Patent 0946508 <lb/>(EP&apos;508), US Patent 4214090 (US&apos;090) and PCT International <lb/>Application WO 96/16954 (WO&apos;954) &quot;expressly disclosed and/or <lb/>provide sufficient teaching and guidance in respect of <lb/>Chlorantraniliprole and are therefore relevant prior art vis-à-vis <lb/>IN&apos;307&quot;. It is further asserted, in para 101, thus: &quot;... Claim 1 of <lb/>IN&apos;307 discloses and claims Chlorantraniliprole. The corresponding <lb/>claim/coverage for Chlorantraniliprole in IN&apos;978 is expressly present <lb/>in Claim 22 as granted&quot;. <lb/>11.21 It has already been noticed, hereinabove, that the Markush <lb/>formula claimed in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307 was not, in fact, claimed in <lb/>Claim 22 of IN&apos;978.

			<body>already opined that the manner in which the defendant has arrived at <lb/>CTPR, or the Markush structure claimed in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, from <lb/>Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, in paras 101-102, and 103, of the written <lb/>statement, respectively, indicate that the defendant has cherry picked <lb/>select substitutions from the mass of substitutions suggested in Claim <lb/>22 of IN&apos;978, applying, in the process, hindsight knowledge. There is <lb/>nothing, in the written statement, to indicate the basis for the <lb/>selections made by the defendant, for substitution on the Markush <lb/>moiety claimed in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. The defendant does not aver, <lb/>or plead, that the teachings in IN&apos;978 contained any such material as <lb/>would propel a person skilled in the art to synthesise, from the <lb/>Markush formula in Claim 22, the compound having the Markush <lb/>formula in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307. No reference is made to any such <lb/>specific or specialised properties of CTPR, to arrive at which requisite <lb/>teaching is contained in IN&apos;978. Prima facie, therefore, the present <lb/>case is one of classic hindsight substitution of radicals on a Markush <lb/>moiety, and cannot be said to make out a case of obviousness, of <lb/>Claim 1 in IN&apos;307 or of CTPR, in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 or any other <lb/>teaching contained in IN&apos;978, as granted. <lb/>11.22 Mr. Sai Deepak has also contended that, in &quot;multiple patent <lb/>applications and patents&quot;, the plaintiff has asserted that CTPR was <lb/>first claimed and disclosed in US 6747047, which was the equivalent <lb/>of IN&apos;978. Additionally, he has submitted that other patentees in the <lb/>same field have, in patent applications filed by them, stated that <lb/>US&apos;047 claimed and disclosed CTPR. He has also sought to <lb/></body>

			<body>highlight, in this context, the fact that some of the admissions <lb/>contained in the applications relating to these patents were by George <lb/>Philip Lahm, who was one of the inventors of the suit patent and of <lb/>IN&apos;978. <lb/>11.23 Mr. Sethi has contended, in rebuttal, that statements made in <lb/>documents relating to other patents cannot be relied upon or treated as <lb/>evidence, by the defendants, to make out a case of vulnerability of the <lb/>suit patent in the present case, as their validity has not been tested in <lb/>these proceedings. I entirely agree with this submission. While it is <lb/>true that the degree of proof, which the defendant is required to attain, <lb/>is only that of a credible challenge, and the challenge need only to <lb/>disclose vulnerability of the suit patent, rather than a clear cut case for <lb/>revocation, the challenge has, nevertheless, to be credible. Reliance <lb/>on documents filed by other patentees in applications relating to other <lb/>patents, or even on documents filed by the plaintiff itself while <lb/>applying for other patents, cannot be relied upon, prima facie, to plead <lb/>the existence of a credible challenge to the validity of the suit patent. <lb/>These are unrelated documents, pertaining to unrelated patent <lb/>applications. Mr. Sethi is correct in pointing out that the validity of the <lb/>statements have not been tested in the present proceedings and that, <lb/>therefore, at a prima facie stage, this Court cannot hold one way or <lb/>another, relying on such material. Needless to say, this would not <lb/>inhibit the defendant from relying on such material during the course <lb/>of trial in the present case. <lb/></body>

			<body>11.24 Mr. Sethi has relied, for this purpose, on the order, dated 8 th <lb/>December, 2015 in F. Hoffmann-La Roche 22 and, on a reading of the <lb/>said decision, the reliance is found to be apt. In para 61 of the order, <lb/>the Division Bench of this Court has held it to be &quot;a cardinal principle <lb/>of claim construction that the claim must be interpreted on its own <lb/>language and if it is clear then resort cannot be had to subsequent <lb/>statements or documents either to enlarge the scope or to narrow the <lb/>same&quot;. In so holding, the Division Bench relied on the earlier <lb/>Division Bench ruling in Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corpn v. Glenmark <lb/>Pharmaceuticals 41 , in which, too, it was held that &quot;claim construction <lb/>to determine the coverage in the suit patent is to be determined <lb/>objectively on its own terms with regard to the words used by the <lb/>inventor and the context of the invention in terms of knowledge <lb/>existing in the industry&quot;. Equally, reliance was placed on Glaverbel <lb/>SA v British Coal Corpn 42 , which disapproves construction of a plain <lb/>&quot;with an eye on prior material, in order to avoid its effect&quot;. <lb/>11.25 The sequitur would be that when, as in the present case, the <lb/>Court has examined Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, vis-à-vis the suit patent, and <lb/>found the submission, of the defendant, that the suit patent was <lb/>disclosed in, taught by, or obvious from Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, to be <lb/>prima facie unacceptable, no occasion would arise for the Court to <lb/>forage through declarations or assertions made by other patentees, or <lb/>even by the plaintiff, while applying for other patents.

			<body>specifications of the genus patent and specie patent, which are before <lb/>the Court, has necessarily to prevail. <lb/>11.26 It cannot be said, therefore, that the defendant has been able to <lb/>establish, prima facie, that CTPR was either claimed, or disclosed, in <lb/>Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, or that Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, or CTPR itself, was <lb/>obvious from Claim 22 in IN&apos;978. <lb/>12. Vulnerability of the suit patent IN&apos;307 on the ground of <lb/>anticipation by prior claiming, under Section 13(1)(b) read with <lb/>Section 64(1)(a) of the Patents Act <lb/>12.1 Mr. Sai Deepak urges that the claims in IN&apos;307 are invalid on <lb/>the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, for which statutory <lb/>recognition is to be found in Section 13(1)(b) 43 read with Section <lb/>64(1)(a) 44 of the Patents Act. In fact, the reliance on Section 13(1)(b) is <lb/>largely superfluous, as the ingredients of the said provision stands <lb/>43 &quot;13. Search for anticipation by previous publication and by prior claim. -<lb/>(1) <lb/>The examiner to whom an application for a patent is referred under section 12 <lb/>shall make investigation for the purpose of ascertaining whether the invention so far as <lb/>claimed in any claim of the complete specification -<lb/>(a) <lb/>has been anticipated by publication before the date of filing of the <lb/>applicant&apos;s complete specification in any specification filed in pursuance of an <lb/>application for a patent made in India and dated on or after the 1st day of <lb/>January, 1912; <lb/>(b) <lb/>is claimed in any claim of any other complete specification published <lb/>on or after the date of filing of the applicant&apos;s complete specification, being a <lb/>specification filed in pursuance of an application for a patent made in India and <lb/>dated before or claiming the priority date earlier than that date. <lb/>44 &quot;64. Revocation of patents -<lb/>(1) <lb/>Subject to the provisions contained in this Act, a patent, whether granted before or after <lb/>the commencement of this Act, may, be revoked on a petition of any person interested or of the <lb/>Central Government by the Appellate Board or on a counterclaim in a suit for infringement of the <lb/>patent by the High Court on any of the following grounds, that is to say -<lb/>(a) <lb/>that the invention, so far as claimed in any claim of the complete specification, <lb/>was claimed in a valid claim of earlier priority date contained in the complete <lb/>specification of another patent granted in India;&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>reiterated in Section 64(1)(a) which, insofar as the liability to revocation <lb/>of a patent is concerned, is self contained. <lb/>12.2 Mr. Sai Deepak submits that, on the satisfaction of three <lb/>conditions, a suit patent would stand invalidated under Section <lb/>13(1)(b)/Section 64(1)(a). These three conditions, to be found in <lb/>either of these provisions, are that (i) the claim in the suit patent is <lb/>claimed in any claim of any other complete specification, (ii) such <lb/>complete specification must have been filed in pursuance of an <lb/>application for a patent in India and (iii) the priority date claimed in <lb/>such complete specification must be earlier in point of time to the <lb/>priority date of the suit patent. If these three conditions are fulfilled, <lb/>Mr. Sai Deepak submits that Section 13(1)(b)/Section 64(1)(a) renders <lb/>the date of publication of the suit patent irrelevant. As such, the fact <lb/>that IN&apos;978 was published after the priority date of IN&apos;307, submits <lb/>Mr. Sai Deepak, makes no difference to the applicability of Section <lb/>13(1)(b). <lb/>12.3 Aropos the first requirement of Section 13(1)(b), which is the <lb/>claiming, of the suit patent (IN&apos;307) in any claim of any other <lb/>complete specification, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on paras 23 to 27 of the <lb/>plaint to contend that the plaintiff has acknowledged and admitted the <lb/>coverage of CTPR within IN&apos;978 i.e. the genus patent. These paras <lb/>already stand reproduced in para 11.16 supra. Mr. Sai Deepak&apos;s <lb/>contention is that, having thus admitted the coverage of CTPR under <lb/>IN&apos;978 (which assertion the defendants deny), the only basis for the <lb/></body>

			<body>assertion, by the plaintiff, regarding validity of IN&apos;307, is that CTPR <lb/>is not disclosed in IN&apos;978. This, according to him, is an irrelevant <lb/>consideration, as disclosure forms no part of Section 13(1)(b). In <lb/>other words, Mr. Sai Deepak would contend, irrespective of whether <lb/>the claim in the suit patent is, or is not, disclosed in the earlier genus <lb/>patent, the claim in the suit patent would nonetheless be vulnerable to <lb/>revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, if it <lb/>satisfies the three conditions of Section 13(1)(b). <lb/>12.4 Apropos the second condition, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on the <lb/>bibliographic details of IN&apos;978 and IN&apos;307, as provided in the plaint, <lb/>which indicate that IN&apos;307 claimed priority dates (based on the date <lb/>of filing of the corresponding US patents) of 13 th August, 2001 (vis-à-<lb/>vis US 60/311,919), 21 st September, 2001 (vis-à-vis US 60/324,128) <lb/>and 2 nd April, 2002 (vis-à-vis US 60/396,661), whereas IN&apos;978 <lb/>claimed the priority dates 22 nd March, 2000 (vis-à-vis US <lb/>60/191,242), 27 th July, 2000 (vis-à-vis US 60/220,232), 11 th <lb/>December, 2000 (vis-à-vis US 60/254,635) and 17 th January, 2001 <lb/>(vis-à-vis US 60/262,015). As the earliest priority date of IN&apos;307 is <lb/>later than the latest priority date of IN&apos;978. Mr. Sai Deepak submits <lb/>that the second condition of Section 13(1)(b), with respect to &quot;priority <lb/>of priority dates&quot; also stands satisfied. <lb/>12.5 The third condition in Section 13(1)(b), Mr. Sai Deepak points <lb/>out, obviously stands satisfied as both IN&apos;978 and IN&apos;307 are Indian <lb/>patents. <lb/></body>

			<body>12.6 Having thus attempted to demonstrate that the three conditions <lb/>of Section 13(1)(b)/ Section 64(1)(a), which render IN&apos;307 vulnerable <lb/>to revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming stand <lb/>satisfied, Mr. Sai Deepak submits that no statutory exception or <lb/>defence is available in such a case. Whether, or not, the claim of the <lb/>suit patent has been disclosed in the genus patent, submits Mr. Sai <lb/>Deepak, is entirely irrelevant and foreign to Section 13(1)(b). It is not <lb/>open, in other words, according to Mr. Sai Deepak, for the plaintiff to <lb/>escape the rigour of Section 13(1)(b) by contending that CTPR was <lb/>not disclosed in IN&apos;978. <lb/>12.7 In para 20 of the written submissions filed by the defendant, it <lb/>is additionally asserted thus: <lb/>&quot;Critically, it is not important for the scope of the prior claim <lb/>of the prior patent and the impugned claim of the impugned <lb/>patent to be identical. If it is established that the subject-<lb/>matter claimed in the impugned patent falls within the scope <lb/>of/is covered by the prior claim of the prior patent, then the <lb/>claim of the impugned patent is invalid to that extent.&quot; <lb/>As such, Mr. Sai Deepak submits that, as &quot;Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 <lb/>encompasses within its scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of the <lb/>impugned patent IN&apos;307&quot;, the entire Claim 1 of IN&apos;307 is rendered <lb/>vulnerable to revocation. <lb/>12.8 In this context, Mr. Sai Deepak has placed reliance on the <lb/>judgment dated 2 nd December, 1966 of the UK Patents Appeal <lb/></body>

			<body>Tribunal in In Re: Merck &amp; Co. (MACEK&apos;s) Patent 45 , rendered in the <lb/>context of Section 14(1)(c) of the United Kingdom Patents Act, 1949 <lb/>(the &quot;UK Patents Act&quot;) which, according to Mr. Sai Deepak, is in pari <lb/>materia with Section 13(1)(b) of the Patents Act. Specific reliance <lb/>has been placed on the following passages from the said decision: <lb/>&quot;The 1949 Act introduced this phrase &quot;the invention so far as <lb/>claimed in any claim&quot; not only in section 14 (1)(c) but <lb/>elsewhere in the Act and in particular in section 14(1)(b) <lb/>(prior publication), section 14(1)(d) (prior user) and section <lb/>14(1)(e) (obviousness). The acceptance of the principle of <lb/>multiple priorities required some such introduction, so that it <lb/>cannot be assumed that Parliament in phrasing the alteration <lb/>as it did was intending to do more than to adjust the Act to <lb/>accord with this principle, It would be a matter of surprise if, <lb/>in purporting to do this, the legislature had made a <lb/>fundamental alteration in the principles by which the validity <lb/>of claimed monopolies has hitherto been determined. So far <lb/>as concerns prior publication and prior user, if a claim to a <lb/>manner of manufacture includes one embodiment of it which <lb/>is not new, that claim has always been regarded as invalid <lb/>whatever novel and ingenious embodiments the claim also <lb/>covers (see Molins v. Industrial Machinery Co. Ltd. (1938) <lb/>55 R.P.C. 31). So too with obviousness (Woodrow v. Long <lb/>Humphreys &amp; Co. (1934) 51 R.P.C. 25); and unless and until <lb/>the patentee has been able, by suitable amendment, to exclude <lb/>from the claim the invalid portion of the monopoly, the taint <lb/>of invalidity attaches to it in its fulness and deprives it of <lb/>monopoly effect. <lb/>There would appear to be no ground for construing the <lb/>phrase &quot;the invention so far as claimed in any claim&quot; in <lb/>different senses in the sub-divisions of section 14(1), so that, <lb/>if the cited prior claim on its fair construction can be seen to <lb/>grant as a manner of manufacture that which the later claim <lb/>on its fair construction would re-monopolise, the objection of <lb/>prior claiming is established, and this despite the inclusion in <lb/>45 [1967]6 RPC 157 <lb/></body>

			<body>the later claim of variants of the manner of manufacture to <lb/>which no objection can properly be raised. The later <lb/>circumstance will of course be of concern in the <lb/>determination of the relief to be accorded if and when the <lb/>plea is established, but it cannot shield a vulnerable <lb/>embodiment of the invention claimed from attack on the <lb/>ground of pre-claiming any more effectively than it can from <lb/>the other objections available at the opposition stage.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis provided by the defendant in the written <lb/>submissions) <lb/>(I may note, here, that para 26 of the written submissions filed by the <lb/>defendant also refers to another extract, purportedly from the decision <lb/>in In Re: Merck &amp; Co 45 , but that the said extract does not appear to <lb/>form part of the judgment, and only figures in the head note.) <lb/>12.9 Applying this decision, it is contended by Mr. Sai Deepak that, <lb/>even if Claim 1 in IN&apos;307 included variants which were outside the <lb/>scope of Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, to the extent the claim in Claim 1 of <lb/>IN&apos;307 fell within the scope of Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 -which would <lb/>include the claim for patenting of CTPR -Claim 1 in IN&apos;307 is <lb/>rendered vulnerable, at least prima facie. In this context, he goes on to <lb/>submit that though, ordinarily, any examination of the applicability of <lb/>Section 13(1)(b) would require complete construction of the claims in <lb/>the suit patent and the genus patent, that exercise is obviated in the <lb/>present case, in view of the admission, by the plaintiff, of the <lb/>coverage of CTPR within Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/>12.10 Responding to the arguments of Mr. Sai Deepak, Mr. Sethi <lb/>submits that Section 13(1)(b) applies only where, on comparison of <lb/></body>

			<body>claims, the claim in the specie patent is found to be identical to that in <lb/>the genus patent. It is not enough, submits Mr. Sethi, that the claim in <lb/>the specie patent is comprehended in the claim in the genus patent; it <lb/>must be specifically claimed therein. He relies, for this purpose, on <lb/>the ruling of the US Courts of Customs and Patent Appeals in In re. <lb/>Vogel 46 and of the UK Supreme Court in In re. Daikin Kogyo Ltd 47 <lb/>which, he submits, also explains In Re: Merck &amp; Co 45 , on which Mr. <lb/>Sai Deepak relied. Mr. Sethi points out that approximately 4000 <lb/>compounds have been exemplified in IN&apos;978, none of which is CTPR. <lb/>Apropos the Form 27s filed for IN&apos;978, Mr. Sethi points out that they <lb/>reflected IN&apos;978 as &quot;worked&quot; only after the plaintiff&apos;s CTPR products <lb/>CORAGEN and FERTERRA had been manufactured and tested. This <lb/>was because CTPR was encompassed within the scope of IN&apos;978, but <lb/>was not claimed or disclosed therein. To emphasise this distinction, <lb/>Mr. Sethi relies on the judgement of a coordinate bench of this Court <lb/>in Astrazeneca AB v. Emcure Pharmaceuticals 48 . He submits that <lb/>there is a distinction between that which is &quot;encompassed&quot; in a claim <lb/>and that which is claimed or covered thereby. He submits that, if the <lb/>interpretation sought to be advanced by Mr. Sai Deepak were to be <lb/>accepted, it would seriously compromise advancement in <lb/>pharmaceuticals, as, on the principle that all entities which may come <lb/>within the broad coverage of a claimed Markush moiety cannot be <lb/>patented, the incentive to invent superior pharmaceutical products <lb/>would be lost. This is a factor which, submits Mr. Sethi, has been <lb/></body>

			<body>noted by this Court in its judgement in F. Hoffman la Roche 8 . He <lb/>submits that the insecticidal activity of CTPR was superior to that of <lb/>the compounds envisaged in IN&apos;978. He also submits that the Patents <lb/>Act permits coverage of one product by more than one patent, in <lb/>Sections 3(d), 19, 88(3), 91 and 141. Thus, submits Mr Sethi, the <lb/>objection of Mr Sai Deepak, predicated on Section 64(1)(a)/13(1)(b) <lb/>of the Patents Act, is without substance. <lb/>12.11 Section 64(1)(a) provides, as a ground for revoking a patent <lb/>already granted, claiming, of the invention claimed in the claim of the <lb/>said patent, in a valid claim of earlier priority date, contained in the <lb/>complete specification of another patent granted in India. The <lb/>statutory preconditions, for this clause to apply as a ground for <lb/>alleging invalidation of the suit patent, are that (i) the invention <lb/>claimed in the claim, under consideration, of the suit patent, was <lb/>claimed in another valid claim, (ii) said valid claim was of earlier <lb/>priority date and (iii) said valid claim was contained in the complete <lb/>specification of another patent granted in India (for ease of reference, <lb/>&quot;the prior patent&quot;). A defendant who seeks to allege invalidity, or <lb/>vulnerability, of a suit patent, under Section 64(1)(a), therefore, <lb/>predicates his case on the premise that the prior patent was valid. An <lb/>allegation that the prior patent was invalid is fatal to any challenge to <lb/>the validity of the suit patent under Section 64(1)(a). The defendant <lb/>in the present case, in asserting vulnerability of IN&apos;307 as having been <lb/>anticipated by prior claiming in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, therefore, has to <lb/>accede to the validity of Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 119 of 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>12.12 Having said that, it is, of course, always open to the defendant, <lb/>as an alternative plea, that Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 was itself invalid. As I <lb/>have already held here in before, however, no challenge to the validity <lb/>of Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 having ever been raised by the defendant, least <lb/>of all in these proceedings, I am not willing to enter into that aspect. I <lb/>proceed, therefore, on the premise that Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 was a <lb/>valid claim, validly granted. <lb/>12.13 CTPR is the &quot;invention… claimed in Claim 1 of the complete <lb/>specification&quot; in IN&apos;307, i.e. the suit patent. The &quot;valid claim of <lb/>earlier priority date&quot; in the prior patent, for the purposes of Section <lb/>64(1)(a), as alleged by Mr. Sai Deepak, is Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/>Section 64(1)(a) would, therefore, render the suit patent vulnerable if <lb/>CTPR is, prima facie, claimed in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/>12.14 I have already held, hereinabove, that CTPR is not claimed, or <lb/>even disclosed, in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 claims a <lb/>Markush moiety. It is possible to travel from said Markush moiety to <lb/>Claim 1 in IN&apos;307, or to CTPR, only by cherry picking select radicals <lb/>out of the innumerable choices provided in the complete <lb/>specifications accompanying Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, for substitution on <lb/>said Markush moiety. Save and except for demonstrating how, by <lb/>substituting such select radicals, it is possible to move from the <lb/>Markush moiety in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 to Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, or to <lb/>CTPR, the defendant has, in its written statement, not indicated any <lb/>teaching or guidance, available in the complete specifications of <lb/></body>

			<body>IN&apos;278, as would guide a person skilled in the art to pick the select <lb/>radicals and substitute them on the Markush moiety in Claim 22 of <lb/>IN&apos;978, so as to &quot;lead&quot; him to CTPR. Neither CTPR, nor the <lb/>Markush formula claimed in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, is obvious from the <lb/>disclosure provided in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/>12.15 The defendant appears to be aware of this legal position, as is <lb/>apparent from the assertion, in para 21 of the written submissions filed <lb/>by the defendant that &quot;Claim 22 of IN&apos;978 encompasses within its <lb/>scope the entire principal claim, Claim 1 of the impugned patent <lb/>IN&apos;307, thereby rendering the entirety of the principal claim of IN 307 <lb/>vulnerable to revocation&quot; 49 . The correctness of this argument of the <lb/>defendant appears to be somewhat doubtful and, in fact, also appears <lb/>to be contrary to the contention, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that the words <lb/>used in Section 13(1)(b) have to be strictly construed. While <lb/>advancing this contention, the defendant has introduced two new <lb/>concepts, which find no place in Section 13(1)(b), viz. the concepts of <lb/>&quot;scope&quot; and &quot;coverage&quot;. Section 13(1)(b) clearly applies where a <lb/>claim in the suit patent &quot;is claimed in any claim of any other complete <lb/>specification&quot;. It does not make any reference either to the scope of <lb/>the claim or the coverage of the claim. What is required therefore, <lb/>prima facie, is comparison of the claims, not whether the claim in the <lb/>suit patent is covered by or within the scope of the claim in the genus <lb/>patent. This position is also conceded by the defendant, in its written <lb/>submissions, by accepting that, ordinarily, a challenge of anticipation <lb/>49 Refer para 12.8 supra <lb/></body>

			<body>by prior claiming has to be decided on a claim-to-claim comparison. <lb/>The defendant would seek to contend that, in the present case, this <lb/>exercise is obviated because of the admission -as the defendant <lb/>would perceive it -by the plaintiff, in its plaint and replication, of the <lb/>coverage of CTPR in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. No such admission is, as <lb/>already held here in before, discernible from the paragraphs on which <lb/>the defendant seeks to place reliance. A claim-to-claim comparison, <lb/>even as per the defendant is, therefore, necessary, in order to examine <lb/>the applicability of Section 64(1)(a) -or, for that matter, Section <lb/>13(1)(b) -to the facts of the present case. Such comparison, when <lb/>undertaken, does not make out a prima facie case that these provisions <lb/>apply. <lb/>12.16 The defendant has made a strained effort to justify invocation of <lb/>Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a) by contending that, even if Claim 1 in <lb/>IN&apos;307 includes variants which were outside the scope of Claim 22 in <lb/>IN&apos;978, the former claim was, nonetheless, rendered prima facie <lb/>vulnerable to the extent it fell within the scope of Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, <lb/>i.e. to the extent it claimed CTPR. Neither Section 13(1)(b), nor <lb/>Section 64(1)(a), in my considered opinion, lends itself to such an <lb/>interpretation. All that these provisions require the Court -or <lb/>authority before whom the challenge to the validity is raised -to do is <lb/>to assess whether the invention, insofar <lb/>12.17 as it has been claimed in the suit patent, was, or was not, <lb/>claimed in the prior patent. CTPR, directly or indirectly, is not <lb/></body>

			<body>claimed in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. The highest that the defendant can <lb/>assert, at least at this juncture, is that CTPR, as an arthropodicidal <lb/>anthranilamide, falls within the broader Markush coverage of Claim <lb/>22 of IN&apos;978. In the discussion here in before, I have already opined <lb/>that the sequitur of any such coverage cannot be that CTPR has been <lb/>claimed in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/>12.18 What Mr. Sai Deepak seeks to contend is, essentially, this: &quot;Let <lb/>us assume CTPR was not disclosed in IN&apos;978. No matter, as <lb/>disclosure is irrelevant for the purposes of Section 13(1)(b). The <lb/>plaintiff has acknowledged that CTPR comes within the coverage of <lb/>Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. That is sufficient to make out, at least on a <lb/>prima facie basis, a case of vulnerability of the suit patent, under <lb/>Section 13(1)(b)/64(1)(a).&quot; There is, in my view, a subtle fallacy in <lb/>this argument. The Patents Act does not define &quot;coverage&quot;. Indeed, <lb/>coverage, as a concept, is not even envisaged by the Patents Act. In <lb/>patent law, there are coverages and coverages. <lb/>Where the <lb/>substitutions to be effected on the claimed moiety are limited and <lb/>easily discernible to a person skilled in the art, the resultant products <lb/>may be obvious from the genus patent, and any separate species patent <lb/>issued in respect of such products may become vulnerable to <lb/>revocation. Where, however, the genus claim is in the form of a <lb/>Markush formula, with multifarious suggested substitutions, they, <lb/>unless the complete specifications of the genus patent instruct, or <lb/>teach, the person skilled in the art to effect the requisite substitutions <lb/>in order to arrive at the specie patent, the specie patent cannot be <lb/></body>

			<body>treated as vulnerable to revocation. The question is, ultimately, one of <lb/>degree. No cast iron formula is possible, and it would be for the Court <lb/>to examine, from the genus patent and specie patent, as to whether the <lb/>latter is obvious from the former. Mere coverage, therefore, does not, <lb/>in every case, result in obviousness. In the present case, even if the <lb/>Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, or CTPR itself, falls <lb/>within the overall coverage of the Markush structure claimed in Claim <lb/>22 of IN&apos;978 that, by itself, cannot result in any claiming, in Claim 22 <lb/>of IN&apos;978, of CTPR, or of the Markush structure claimed in Claim 1 <lb/>of IN&apos;307. <lb/>12.19 In Re: Merck &amp; Company 45 is, in my view, clearly <lb/>distinguishable. Merck, in that case, applied for a patent, which was <lb/>opposed on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming. The <lb/>invention, for which Merck sought to patent, was &quot;a composition <lb/>having enhanced bactericidal activity comprising novobiocin in <lb/>combination with at least one other antibiotic selected from the <lb/>following, namely, penicillin, tetracycline, oxytetracycline, <lb/>chlortetracycline, <lb/>streptomycin, <lb/>chloramphenicol, <lb/>bacitracin, <lb/>neomycin, spiramycin, streptothricin and grisein&quot;. Thus, the claim <lb/>was comprehensive in nature, permitting alternative additions to <lb/>novobiocin, in the form of one or more of the named antibiotics. The <lb/>Patents Appeal Tribunal (&quot;the Tribunal&quot;), before which the case came <lb/>up, observed that the prior claim, in that case, read &quot;A therapeutic <lb/>composition, comprising novobiocin and a tetracycline&quot;. Merck&apos;s <lb/>claim also included, expressly, novobiocin with tetracycline, <lb/></body>

			<body>oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline as suggested additives. <lb/>Elucidating the principle of anticipation by prior claiming, correctly, <lb/>as whether &quot;the cited prior claim on its fair construction can be seen to <lb/>grant as a manner of manufacture that which the latter claim on its fair <lb/>construction would re-monopolise&quot;, the Tribunal held that Merck&apos;s <lb/>patent stood claimed, prior in point of time, by the prior patent. The <lb/>prior patent, it was noted, clearly claimed novobiocin and tetracycline <lb/>combinations, to which Merck&apos;s claim extended. <lb/>12.20 This case, in fact, presents a classical example of an instance in <lb/>which the prior genus patent, though worded in general terms, may <lb/>still invalidate a subsequent specie patent, where the latter is, to a <lb/>person skilled in the art, obvious from the former. In the case before <lb/>the Tribunal, in fact, the degree of skill required to be possessed by <lb/>the &quot;person skilled in the art&quot; was also minimal, as, in effect, both <lb/>genus and species patents claimed novobiocin in combination with a <lb/>tetracycline. There is obviously no similarity, whatsoever, between <lb/>the facts in In Re: Merck &amp; Co. 45 and the present. In Re: Merck &amp; <lb/>Co 45 did not even deal with a Markush claim. <lb/>12.21 In view thereof, no prima facie case of invalidity, or even <lb/>vulnerability, of Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, or of CTPR, on the ground of <lb/>anticipation by prior claiming, under Section 64(1)(a), can be said to <lb/>have been made out. <lb/></body>

			<body>hindsight analysis. As such, he submits that CTPR is not disclosed in <lb/>any of these patents, namely US&apos;424, US&apos;357 and EP&apos;508. EP&apos;508, <lb/>in fact, he submits is the European equivalent of US&apos;357 and has been <lb/>separately cited by the defendant only to make it appear that there has <lb/>been anticipation by a multitude of prior patents. US&apos;424 and <lb/>US&apos;357, submits Mr. Sethi, are in the nature of Markush claims <lb/>enveloping millions of compounds. It cannot be said that, in these <lb/>patents, CTPR was published. Apart from Eli Lilly 19 , Mr. Sethi relies <lb/>on Dr Reddy&apos;s Laboratories 26 . <lb/>13.4 On the allegation, of Mr. Sai Deepak, that, in the production of <lb/>CTPR, there is no &quot;inventive step&quot; involved, Mr. Sethi submits that no <lb/>person, skilled in the art, was in the position to produce CTPR from <lb/>any of the alleged prior art documents on which Mr. Sai Deepak <lb/>places reliance. Nor, he points out, has any material been produced <lb/>by the defendant to support such a submission. He highlights the fact <lb/>that, till the suit patent, CTPR was never invented by anyone after <lb/>publication of IN&apos;978. CTPR, in fact, he submits, was a selection <lb/>patent, out of the Markush structure claimed in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/>Relying on Farbenindustrie 21 , Mr. Sethi submits that such selection <lb/>patents, so as to obtain additional or advantageous results, are valid. <lb/>He relies, additionally, on Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme Corpn 41 , Takeda <lb/>Chemical Industries v. Alphapharm 51 and the judgment of a <lb/>coordinate Single Bench of this Court in Bristol Myers Squibb <lb/>51 492 F. 3d. 1350 <lb/></body>

			<body>Holdings Ireland Ltd v. B.D.R. Pharmaceuticals International Pvt <lb/>Ltd 52 . <lb/>13.5 Section 64(1)(e) starts with the words &quot;that the invention so far <lb/>as claimed in any claim of the complete specification is not new&quot;. <lb/>This necessarily refers us back to the definition of &quot;new invention&quot; in <lb/>clause (l) of Section 2 as meaning &quot;any invention or technology which <lb/>has not been anticipated by publication in any document or used in the <lb/>country or elsewhere in the world before the date of filing of patent <lb/>application with complete specification, i.e., the subject matter has not <lb/>fallen in public domain or that it does not form part of the state of the <lb/>art&quot;. &quot;Anticipation&quot;, when used in the Patents Act, has its own <lb/>peculiar legal connotation. Though &quot;anticipation&quot;, per se, is not <lb/>separately defined, Section 13 provides for anticipation only by prior <lb/>publication or by prior claim. Section 64(1)(e) deals with the liability <lb/>of a patent to revocation on the ground of anticipation by prior <lb/>publication. In order for anticipation by prior publication to constitute <lb/>the basis for revoking a patent under Section 64(1)(e), it is necessary <lb/>that, consequent to such anticipation, the patent is no longer &quot;new&quot;; <lb/>which in other words, the invention patented thereby has lost its <lb/>character as a &quot;new invention&quot;, by reason of anticipation by prior <lb/>publication. Section 64(1)(e), therefore, requires satisfaction of two <lb/>indicia, viz. (i) that there has been anticipation by prior publication <lb/>and (ii) as a consequence, the invention cannot be treated as a &quot;new <lb/>invention&quot;. This is counterbalanced by the definition of &quot;new <lb/>52 2020 SCC OnLine Del 1700 <lb/></body>

			<body>invention&quot;, which envisages absence of novelty either on account of <lb/>anticipation by publication, or on account of use. We are not, in the <lb/>present case, concerned with loss of novelty on account of prior use of <lb/>the invention in the suit patent, i.e. CTPR, no such case having been <lb/>pleaded by the defendant. The defendant pleads loss of novelty on the <lb/>ground of anticipation by prior publication. <lb/>13.6 Section 64(1)(e) is, on a plain reading, somewhat peculiarly -<lb/>and significantly -worded. The words &quot;before the priority date of the <lb/>claim&quot; succeeds the first part of the clause, i.e. the words &quot;what was <lb/>publicly known or publicly used in India&quot;. No such caveat as to time <lb/>follows the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals with <lb/>publication in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to <lb/>in Section 13. Three circumstances are, therefore, contemplated, in <lb/>Section 64(1)(e) as divesting the invention in the suit patent of <lb/>novelty, viz. (i) public knowledge in India before the priority date of <lb/>the claim in the suit patent, (ii) public usage in India before the <lb/>priority date of the claim in the suit patent and (iii) publication in <lb/>India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in Section 13. <lb/>Section 64(1)(e) does not, therefore, envisage publication of the <lb/>invention in India or elsewhere in any of the documents referred to in <lb/>Section 13 prior to the priority date of the claim in the suit patent. <lb/>The reference, by Mr. Sethi, to the priority date of the suit patent, does <lb/>not, therefore, appear to be appropriate, in view of the manner in <lb/>which Section 64(1)(e) has been crafted by the legislature. <lb/></body>

			<body>13.7 That does not, however, mean that the circumstance of prior <lb/>publication, envisaged in the second part of Section 64(1)(e), is <lb/>completely open ended, with no terminus ad quem. What, then, is the <lb/>terminus ad quem, for the purposes of prior publication under Section <lb/>64(1)(e) ? The legislature has not deemed it appropriate to provide a <lb/>terminus ad quem for the latter part of Section 64(1)(e), which deals <lb/>with the prior publication, apparently because this part of the clause is <lb/>to be read in conjunction with Section 13, which provides the <lb/>appropriate terminus ad quem, in clauses (1)(a) and (2), which have <lb/>already been reproduced hereinabove, and which envisage <lb/>anticipation by prior publication. The terminus ad quem provided in <lb/>respect of anticipation by prior publication, in clauses (1)(a) and (2) of <lb/>Section 13, is the &quot;date of filing of the applicant&apos;s complete <lb/>specification&quot;, and not the priority date of the suit patent. The priority <lb/>date of the suit patent is, therefore, prima facie irrelevant for the <lb/>purposes of vulnerability on the ground of anticipation by prior <lb/>publication, Section 64(1)(e) read with Section 13 of the Patents Act. <lb/>What has to be seen is whether, prior to the date of filing of the <lb/>complete specification in the suit patent, the invention, i.e. CTPR in <lb/>the present case, was published in India or elsewhere in any <lb/>document. <lb/>13.8 Can there be publication of a patent, relating to an invention <lb/>without disclosure of the invention in the patent? <lb/></body>

			<body>13.9 Publication involves making known to the public the patent <lb/>application. Every application is required to disclose the invention for <lb/>which it relates. Sub-section (4) of Section 10 of the Patents Act 4 <lb/>(already reproduced above) specifically requires disclosure, in the <lb/>complete specification of the patent, not only of the invention, its <lb/>operation or use and the method by which it is to be performed, but <lb/>also its claims defining the scope of the invention for which protection <lb/>is claimed. In order, therefore, for the defendant to be able to <lb/>successfully allege that CTPR was published in US&apos;424 and US&apos;357 <lb/>(being the US equivalent of EP&apos;508), the defendant would have to <lb/>establish that CTPR was disclosed in these patents. <lb/>13.10 IN&apos;307 claims &quot;Arthropodicidal Anthranilamides&quot;. <lb/>The <lb/>opening paragraphs of the Complete Specifications of IN&apos;307, which <lb/>sets out the background of the invention, specifically state that the <lb/>invention &quot;relates to certain Anthranilamides, their N-oxides, <lb/>agriculturally suitable salts and compositions, and methods of their <lb/>use for control of the invertebrate pests such as arthropods in both <lb/>agronomic and non-agronomic environments&quot;. US&apos;424 is titled <lb/>&quot;Inhibitors of Factor XA with a Neutral P1 Specificity Group&quot;. The <lb/>opening Abstract in the Complete Specification states that the <lb/>application &quot;describes inhibitors of factor Xa with a neutral P1 <lb/>specificity group of formula I: <lb/></body>

The Abstract, towards the commencement of <lb/>the complete specifications, reads thus: <lb/>&quot;The present application describes nitrogen-containing <lb/>heteroaromatics and derivatives thereof of formula I: <lb/>or pharmaceutically acceptable salt or prodrug forms thereof, <lb/>wherein J is N or NH and D may be C(=NH)NH2, which are <lb/>useful as inhibitors of factor Xa.&quot; <lb/>The Field of the Invention is described thus: <lb/>&quot;This invention relates generally to nitrogen-containing <lb/>heteroaromatics which are inhibitors of trypsin -like serine <lb/>protease enzymes, especially factor Xa, pharmaceutical <lb/></body>

			<body>compositions containing the same, and methods of using the <lb/>same as anticoagulant agents for treatment and prevention of <lb/>thromboembolic disorders.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>Neither of these patents claims, or discloses, CTPR. Besides, they are <lb/>pharmaceutical patents, relating to pharmaceutical products for <lb/>therapeutic administration. There is also substance in Mr. Sethi&apos;s <lb/>contention that these are also Markush claims, and cannot, therefore, <lb/>be said to &quot;teach&quot; synthesising of CTPR. I am unable, prima facie, to <lb/>convince myself that CTPR stands claimed, or disclosed, in these <lb/>patents. Sans any claim or disclosure of CTPR, it cannot be said that <lb/>CTPR was published either in US&apos;424 or US&apos;357 (or, therefore, in <lb/>EP&apos;508). <lb/>13.11 I also find, in this context, prima facie substance in the <lb/>contention of Mr. Sethi that, in asserting that Claim 1 of US&apos;424 and <lb/>US&apos;357 leads the person skilled in the art to CTPR, the defendant has, <lb/>as in the case of Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, cherry picked selected <lb/>substituents from the substituents suggested in the complete <lb/>specifications relating to the said claims. This is apparent from paras <lb/>114 and 119 of the written statement, which already stand reproduced <lb/>(supra). <lb/>13.12 Para 120 of the written statement further contends that, in <lb/>Example 66 of US&apos;357, the reaction scheme, leading to the <lb/>preparation of CTPR, is disclosed. Unfortunately, while raising all <lb/>these contentions, predicated on US&apos;424 and US&apos;357, the defendant <lb/></body>

			<body>has not chosen to place the complete specifications relating to the said <lb/>patent on record. At a prima facie stage, this fact by itself would be <lb/>sufficient to reject these contentions as making out a case of <lb/>vulnerability of the suit patent. The plaintiff has, however, filed the <lb/>said complete specifications of US&apos;424 and US&apos;357, as granted. I am <lb/>unable to find, in Example 66 in US&apos;357, anything to substantiate the <lb/>averment, in that regard, contained in para 120 of the written <lb/>statement. I may note, here, that no oral arguments, explaining this <lb/>assertion in the written statement, were advanced at the Bar; nor do <lb/>the written submissions of the defendant enlighten on this aspect. <lb/>Nevertheless, for the sake of clarity, Example 66 in US 357 is <lb/>reproduced thus: <lb/>&quot;EXAMPLE 66 <lb/>1-(3-amidinophenyl)-5-[(2&apos;-aminosulfonyl)-3-chloro-[1,1&apos;]-<lb/>biphen -4-yl)aminocarbonyl]-3-methylpyrazole <lb/>Part A: 1-(3-cyanophenyl)-3-methyl-pyrazol-5-yl carboxylic <lb/>acid and 4-bromo-2-chloroaniline were coupled via standard <lb/>conditions (67%). 1 HNMR(CDCl3)δ: 8.27 (d, j=8.79Hz, 1H), <lb/>8.17 (s, lH), 7.82 (t, j=1.80 Hz, 1H), 7.75 (m,2H)7.59 (m, <lb/>2H), 7.42 (dd,j=8.78, 2.2 Hz, lH), 6.72 (s, lH),2.41 (s, 3H) <lb/>ppm. <lb/>Part B: The bromo compound from part A (0.4 g, 0.96 mmol), <lb/>2-t-butylsulfonamide phenylboronic acid (0.32 g, 1.2 mmol), <lb/>2M sodium carbonate (1 mL), and 1:1 toluene/ethanol were <lb/>combined and degassed with nitrogen.

			<body>document, of the suit patent, the defendant would have to establish not <lb/>only that the substitutions, on the Markush moiety, the effecting of <lb/>which would be necessary to arrive at the suit patent are clearly <lb/>disclosed in the prior art, but also, additionally, that the prior art <lb/>contains the requisite teaching which would motivate the person <lb/>skilled in the art to carry out the said substitutions. Ordinarily, this <lb/>would require guidance, in the prior art document, regarding the <lb/>additional advantages which would result, if the substitutions in <lb/>question were made on the Markush moiety claimed therein. In the <lb/>present case, prima facie, neither of these twin requirements stands <lb/>satisfied despite the manifold grounds of challenge raised by the <lb/>defendant, assiduously canvassed, on its behalf, by Mr. Sai Deepak. <lb/>14. Re. Section 53(4) <lb/>14.1 Mr. Sai Deepak also presses, into service, Section 53(4) of the <lb/>Patents Act, which reads as under: <lb/>&quot;Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the <lb/>time being in force, on cessation of the patent right due to <lb/>non-payment of renewal fee or on expiry of the term of <lb/>patent, the subject matter covered by the said patent shall not <lb/>be entitled to any protection.&quot; <lb/>As, in his submission, CTPR stands covered by Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, <lb/>Mr. Sai Deepak submits that, on expiry of the term of IN&apos;978 on 20 th <lb/>March, 2021, the protection available to CTPR from exploitation <lb/>would cease and CTPR would become available in the public domain. <lb/>This, he submits, cannot be avoided by recourse to IN&apos;307, in view of <lb/></body>

			<body>Section 13(1)(b) read with Section 64(1)(a). <lb/>14.2 The submission does not survive for consideration, in view of <lb/>the finding, hereinabove, that CTPR is, in fact, neither claimed nor <lb/>disclosed in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978. <lb/>14.3 That apart, a bare reading of Section 53(4) reveals that it is <lb/>claim-specific and invention-specific. <lb/>Section 53(4) applies, <lb/>therefore, individually and independently, to IN&apos;978 and the suit <lb/>patent (IN&apos;307). Irrespective, therefore, on the expiry of IN&apos;978, the <lb/>protective umbrella of Section 53(4) would continue to remain <lb/>available to IN&apos;307, being a granted patent, till such time IN&apos;307 is <lb/>invalidated by a competent forum. Expressed otherwise, Section <lb/>53(4) cannot authorise exploitation of the invention covered by the <lb/>specie patent by third parties even before the expiry of the specie <lb/>patent, on the presumptive assertion that the specie patent is invalid, <lb/>whether on the ground of anticipation by prior claiming, anticipation, <lb/>by prior publication, or any other ground. <lb/>14.4 I cannot, therefore, agree with Mr. Sai Deepak, even as regards <lb/>the applicability of Section 53(4) of the Patents Act. <lb/>15. Re. Section 3(d) read with Section 64(1)(d) <lb/>15.1 Though this submission of Mr. Sai Deepak, too, does not <lb/>survive for consideration in view of the findings already returned by <lb/>me, it may, nevertheless, be briefly noticed.

			<body>provides, as one of the grounds for revocation of a granted patent, the <lb/>ground &quot;that the subject of any claim of the complete specification is <lb/>not an invention within the meaning of this Act&quot;. Mr. Sai Deepak&apos;s <lb/>submission is that CTPR is not an &quot;invention&quot; within the meaning of <lb/>the Patents Act. Juxtaposed with this, Mr. Sai Deepak invokes <lb/>Section 3(d) to contend that, in the absence of any data demonstrating <lb/>added efficacy of CTPR over which the invention is claimed in <lb/>IN&apos;978, the suit patent is also invalid under Section 3(d). <lb/>15.2 The submissions are interconnected, and effectively stand <lb/>decided by the findings hereinbefore. The basis for this contention is <lb/>elucidated, in para 48 of the written submissions of the defendant, in <lb/>which it is contended that &quot;the complete specifications of the genus <lb/>patent IN&apos;978 and the suit Species Patent IN&apos;307 are identical in all <lb/>material respects with no additional data on efficacy which renders the <lb/>patent vulnerable to revocation under Section 64(1)(d) in view of <lb/>Section 3(d) of the Act&quot;. Reference has been invited, by the <lb/>defendant, in this context, to page 399, vis-à-vis page 76 of the <lb/>defendant&apos;s documents. These are the opening pages of the suit patent <lb/>(IN&apos;307) and the genus patent (IN&apos;978) respectively. The suit patent <lb/>is titled &quot;Arthropodicidal Anthranilamides&quot;, whereas the genus patent <lb/>is titled &quot;Insecticidal Anthranilamides&quot;. The textual &quot;identity&quot; of the <lb/>complete specifications of these two patents, as emphasised in para 48 <lb/>of the written submissions of the defendant, however, is limited to the <lb/>initial recital containing the &quot;Background of the Invention&quot;. The <lb/>&quot;Summary of the Invention&quot;, which follows the &quot;Background&quot;, as <lb/></body>

			<body>which is useful as a synthetic intermediate, for preparing a <lb/>compound of Formula 1.&quot; <lb/>The contention, in para 48 of the written submissions of the <lb/>defendant, that &quot;there is no difference whatsoever in any aspect of the <lb/>disclosure&quot; is, therefore, erroneous and is accordingly rejected. <lb/>15.3 Para 48 of the written submissions of the defendant further <lb/>asserts that &quot;there is no reason stated either in IN&apos;307 for selecting a <lb/>particular molecule from the Markush disclosed in IN&apos;978, nor is any <lb/>additional efficacy either hinted or suggested or disclosed&quot;. This <lb/>contention, too, does not appear to be correct, prima facie. Mr. Sethi <lb/>has pointed out that as many as 13 tests have been explained, in the <lb/>&quot;Biological Examples of the Invention&quot;, in the complete <lb/>specifications of IN&apos;307, which explained the superior insecticidal <lb/>activity of CTPR. These superior insecticidal qualities of CTPR also <lb/>stand borne out in the affidavit of the inventor George Lahm, as filed <lb/>before the US Patents and Trademarks Office along with the <lb/>declaration filed for registration of the US&apos;836 patent, the equivalent <lb/>of the IN&apos;307 patent. It is averred, in the said affidavit, thus: <lb/>&quot;I am familiar with the subject matter of the present <lb/>application and the subject matter of U.S. Patent 6,747,047 of <lb/>which I am also a named inventor. Both the present <lb/>application and U.S. Patent 6.747,047 encompass within their <lb/>subject matter certain insecticidal anthranilamides. U.S. <lb/>Patent 6,747,047 discloses a broad scope wherein, for <lb/>example, J (the ring moiety directly attached to carbonyl) is <lb/>defined as optionally substituted phenyl, naphthyl or, a 5-10 <lb/>membered heteroaromatic mono-or bicyclic ring system. The <lb/></body>

			<body>present invention is drawn to a narrow scope of pyrazole-N-2-<lb/>pyridinyl analogs, that is, J is limited to pyrazole substituted <lb/>with a 2-pyridinyl ring. Further, U.S. Patent 6,747,047 allows <lb/>for broad substitution (up to four broadly defined <lb/>substituents) on the central anthranilamide phenyl ring and <lb/>primarily teaches compounds with monosubstitution on this <lb/>phenyl ring; although, the teachings are not limited to <lb/>monosubstitution. U.S. Patent 6,747,047 does not teach any <lb/>examples of the present invention, that is, wherein J is N-(2-<lb/>pyridinyl)-substituted pyrazole with disubstitution on the <lb/>anthranilamide phenyl ring. Furthermore, in the present <lb/>invention, disubstitution on the aruthranilamide phenyl ring is <lb/>required and the positions are specifically defined. <lb/>Insecticidal activity data from tests conducted by DuPont was <lb/>extracted from DuPont&apos;s biological testing database for <lb/>compounds of the present invention and compounds of U.S. <lb/>Patent 6,747,047 that differ by only one substituent. This data <lb/>is presented in the attached Appendix. The tables in the <lb/>attached Appendix show the activity of compounds of the <lb/>present invention and compares this activity with activity of <lb/>compounds of U.S. Patent 6,747,047, which compounds <lb/>differ in only one substituent, as can be determined by <lb/>examining the structure above the table and column headings <lb/>describing the relevant compounds. Compounds of the <lb/>present invention are designated by their Compound number <lb/>as found in lNDEX TABLE A at paragraph [0248] on pages <lb/>32-33 of the present specification, as published, i.e. US <lb/>2004/0198984 A1. Compounds of U.S. Patent 6,747,047 are <lb/>designated by their Compound number as found in the <lb/>INDEX of TABLE D in columns 163-167 of U.S. Patent <lb/>6,747,047 or are identified by column number and their <lb/>respective position in TABLE 9 of U.S. Patent 6,747,047. <lb/>I consider the data in the Appendix to be particularly pertinent <lb/>to a comparison of the control activity of compounds of the <lb/>present application with compounds of U.S. Patent 6,747,047; <lb/>and I conclude that the data in the Appendix conflrms that <lb/>compounds of the present application provide superior (and <lb/>unexpected) insecticidal activity over compounds in U.S. <lb/>Patent 6,747,047.&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>The primacy required to be accorded to the evidence of the inventor of <lb/>the patented invention stands underscored in para 47 of Bishwanath <lb/>Prasad Radhey Shyam 10 , thus: <lb/>&quot;The learned trial Judge then noted that Purshottam, who was <lb/>stated to be the inventor, and, as such, was the best person to <lb/>describe the invention, did not appear in the witness-box, <lb/>though, as admitted by Sotam Singh (D.W.3), Purshottam had <lb/>attended on some dates of hearing. Sotam Singh tried to <lb/>explain Purshottam&apos;s disappearance from the Court without <lb/>appearing in the witness-box, by saying that he had gone <lb/>away due to illness. The learned Judge found this explanation <lb/>unsatisfactory and rejected it -and in our opinion rightly -<lb/>with the remark that recording of evidence lasted for several <lb/>days and it was not difficult to secure Purshottam&apos;s <lb/>attendance. Apart from being the best informed person about <lb/>the matter in issue, Purshottam was not a stranger. He was a <lb/>partner of the patentee firm and a brother of Sotam Singh <lb/>(D.W.3). He was the best informed person who might have <lb/>answered the charge of lack of novelty levelled by the <lb/>opponent side, by explaining what was the novelty of the <lb/>alleged invention and how and after what research, if any, he <lb/>made this alleged &apos;discovery&apos;. Being a partner of the <lb/>respondent firm, and personally knowing all the <lb/>circumstances of the case, it was his duty as well as of the <lb/>respondent-firm, to examine him as a witness so that the story <lb/>of the particular invention being a new manufacture or <lb/>improvement involving novelty, could, in all its aspects, be <lb/>subjected to cross examination. By keeping Purshottam away <lb/>from the witness-box, the respondent-firm, therefore, took the <lb/>heavy risk of the trial court accepting the charge of lack of <lb/>novelty made by the appellant herein.&quot; <lb/>The plea of want of additional efficacy of CTPR, over the subject <lb/>matter of IN&apos;978, therefore, is also prima facie devoid of merit. <lb/></body>

			<body>15.4 The suit patent cannot, therefore, prima facie be regarded as <lb/>vulnerable to invalidation under Section 64(1)(d) read with Section <lb/>3(d) of the Patents Act. <lb/>Resultantly <lb/>16. As a result, the defendant has not been able to make out any <lb/>prima facie case for treating the suit patent IN&apos;307 as vulnerable to <lb/>revocation or to invalidation. <lb/>B. <lb/>Re. IN&apos;332 <lb/>17. IN&apos;332 is the process patent, associated with IN&apos;307. The title <lb/>of IN&apos;332 is &quot;A Process for Preparing a Compound of Formula 1&quot;, <lb/>where Formula 1 is the Markush moiety claimed in Claim 1 of <lb/>IN&apos;307. IN&apos;332 contains 22 Claims. Claim 1 discloses the process <lb/>for preparing CTPR by reacting benzoxazinone (of Formula 2) with a <lb/>C1-C4 alkyl amine or dimethyl amine. Claims 2 to 22 disclose the <lb/>process steps for arriving at the reactants to be used in Claim 1. As <lb/>such, IN&apos;332 is restricted, entirely, to the process for manufacture of <lb/>CTPR. This position is not disputed by Mr. Sai Deepak. <lb/>18. Mr. Sai Deepak submits that (i) the plaint does not set out how <lb/>IN&apos;332 is being infringed by the defendants, (ii) as IN&apos;307 is <lb/>vulnerable, no protection can be extended to IN&apos;332 either and (iii) <lb/></body>

			<body>research activity is, in any event, protected by Sections 47 53 and <lb/>107A 54 of the Patents Act. <lb/>19. None of these contentions, unfortunately, impress. <lb/>20. It cannot be said that the plaintiff has not asserted IN&apos;332 in the <lb/>plaint. Para-21 of the plaint reads thus: <lb/>&quot;Indian Patent No. 213332 is a valid and subsisting patent <lb/>and has a term of 20 years from 13 th August, 2002 in India <lb/>(i.e. till 13 th August, 2022). The aforesaid patent was neither <lb/>a post in a pre-grant opposition nor in a post-grant opposition <lb/>by any member of the public or interested party in India. By <lb/>virtue of grant of the suit patent 213332, the Plaintiffs have <lb/>the exclusive right to prevent any 3 rd party from the act of <lb/>making, using, offering for sale, selling, exporting or <lb/>53 &quot;47. Grant of patents to be subject to certain conditions -<lb/>The grant of a patent under this Act shall be subject to the condition that -<lb/>(1) <lb/>any machine, apparatus or other article in respect of which the patent is granted <lb/>or any article made by using a process in respect of which the patent is granted, may be <lb/>imported or made by or on behalf of the government for the purpose merely of its own <lb/>use; <lb/>(2) <lb/>any process in respect of which the patent is granted may be used by or on <lb/>behalf of the government for the purpose merely of its own use; <lb/>(3) <lb/>any machine, apparatus or other article in respect of which the patent is granted <lb/>or any article made by the use of the process in respect of which the patent is granted, <lb/>may be made or used, and any process in respect of which the patent is granted may be <lb/>used, by any person, for the purpose merely of experiment or research including the <lb/>imparting of instructions to pupils; and <lb/>(4) <lb/>in the case of a patent in respect of any medicine or drug, the medicine or drug <lb/>may be imported by the Government for the purpose merely of its own use or for <lb/>distribution in any dispensary, hospital or other medical institution maintained by or on <lb/>behalf of the Government or any other dispensary, hospital or medical institution which <lb/>the Central Government may, having regard to the public service that such dispensary, <lb/>hospital or medical institution renders, specify in this behalf by notification in the Official <lb/>Gazette.&quot; <lb/>54 &quot;107A.

			<body>importing the subject matter of the suit patent up to 13 th <lb/>August, 2022. It would be pertinent to note that counterparts <lb/>of this patent had been granted in more than 40 countries and <lb/>in none of these jurisdictions have the said patents been <lb/>revoked or invalidated.&quot; <lb/>Similarly, in para 35 of the plaint, the plaintiff has specifically alleged <lb/>that the imminent commercial launch, by the defendant, of its CTPR <lb/>product &quot;would result in infringement of the suit patents IN 201307 <lb/>and IN 213332&quot;. Allegations, similar to these, are also contained in <lb/>paras 45 and 46 of the plaint, of which the latter concludes with the <lb/>assertion that &quot;it is … reasonable to presume that the Defendant is <lb/>either using or intends to use a process for manufacture of their CTPR <lb/>product which infringes the suit patent IN&apos;332.&quot; The submission of <lb/>Mr. Sai Deepak that the plaintiff does not assert IN&apos;332, or allege <lb/>possible infringement thereof is, therefore, not correct. <lb/>21. On merits, Mr. Sai Deepak submits, in the first instance, that, <lb/>IN&apos;307 being vulnerable, IN&apos;332 is not entitled to protection. This <lb/>submission, obviously, cannot sustain, in view of the findings, <lb/>hereinbefore returned by me, that IN&apos;307 is not vulnerable to <lb/>revocation, and that no prima facie case of such vulnerability has been <lb/>made out by the defendant. Secondly, Mr. Sai Deepak relies on <lb/>Sections 47 and 107A. At a bare reading, these provisions do not <lb/>apply, and the reliance thereon is merely a reliance of desperation, for <lb/>the simple reason that protection is granted, by these provisions, only <lb/>for use of the patented process &quot;for the purpose merely of experiment <lb/>or research&quot;. The plaintiff has sought protection of IN&apos;332 to the <lb/></body>

			<body>extent it is used in the manufacture of CTPR, and it is not the <lb/>defendant&apos;s case that it is merely engaged in experiment or research. <lb/>22. Once I have held that Claim 1 in IN&apos;307/CTPR is entitled to <lb/>protection, the challenge to its validity being prima facie devoid of <lb/>merit, IN&apos;332 also becomes, inexorably, also entitled to protection, <lb/>being a process for manufacture of CTPR. <lb/>23. It has been sought to be contended, by the defendants, that the <lb/>process being used by them to manufacture their CTPR product is not <lb/>the process which is patented in IN&apos;332. Mr. Sethi, however, asserts <lb/>that it is not open to the defendants to adopt this stance, as an <lb/>application for discovery of the process used by the defendants to <lb/>manufacture their CTPR product has been filed by the plaintiff and <lb/>notice has been issued thereon but, despite more than a year having <lb/>lapsed thereafter, the defendants have chosen not to respond to the <lb/>application. As such, he submits, the Court would be entitled to <lb/>presume that the process being adopted by the defendants is the <lb/>process which stands patented in favour of the plaintiff in IN&apos;332. <lb/>24. To my mind, this controversy is really tangential to the issue of <lb/>interim injunction. The plaintiff has only sought protection against <lb/>infringement of IN&apos;332. In case, the defendants are not using the <lb/>process patented in favour of the plaintiff in IN&apos;332, they would, <lb/>naturally, be unaffected by the injunction sought by the plaintiff, <lb/>insofar as protection of the process for manufacture of CTPR, claimed <lb/></body>

			<body>in IN&apos;332, is concerned. If, on the other hand, the defendants are <lb/>using the process claimed in IN&apos;332, this order would apply to them. <lb/>Conclusion <lb/>25. As a result, the plaintiff is held entitled to protection from <lb/>infringement in respect of both the suit patents IN&apos;307 and IN&apos;332. <lb/>26. Pending disposal of the present suit, therefore, the defendant is <lb/>restrained from <lb/>(i) <lb/>manufacturing, using, selling, distributing, advertising, <lb/>exporting, offering for sale or in any other manner, directly or <lb/>indirectly, dealing in any product which infringes the subject <lb/>matter of IN 201307, including the product Chlorantraniliprole, <lb/>claimed that disclosed therein, and <lb/>(ii) using, directly or indirectly, any of the process as claimed <lb/>in IN 213332, for the manufacture of Chlorantraniliprole, or the <lb/>claimed subject matter of IN 201307. <lb/>27. IA 15352/2019 stands allowed in the aforesaid terms. <lb/>IA 2084/2021 in CS (Comm) 69/2021 [F.M.C. Corpn &amp; Anr. v. Best <lb/>Crop Science LLP &amp; Anr.] <lb/></body>

			<body>28. I may note, at the very outset, that the order, dated 11 th <lb/>February, 2021 passed in this application, records thus: <lb/>&quot;Mr. J. Sai Deepak, learned counsel for the defendant, <lb/>submits that the suit patent in the present case is the same as <lb/>that which forms the subject matter of controversy in CS <lb/>(Comm) 611/2019, the submissions on the application under <lb/>Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC would be <lb/>substantially identical in both the cases. He undertakes on <lb/>behalf of his client, to abide by the order passed on to be <lb/>passed in IA 15352/2019 in CS (Comm) 611/2019, in which <lb/>arguments have been heard in part, and learned counsel for <lb/>the plaintiff is presently in rejoinder. That matter is listed for <lb/>hearing on 15 th February, 2021.&quot; <lb/>(Emphasis supplied) <lb/>In view of the statement, made by learned Counsel for the defendant <lb/>in this suit/application, it is obviously not permissible for the <lb/>defendant to sail in a boat different from that in which the defendants <lb/>in CS (Comm) 611/2019 cast oar. Nonetheless, the defendant in the <lb/>present case has advanced detailed arguments, initially through Mr. <lb/>Sai Deepak and, later, through Mr. Gopal Subramanium, learned <lb/>Senior Counsel, assisted by Mr. Saikrishna Rajagopal, learned <lb/>Counsel. Separate written submissions have also been filed by the <lb/>defendant in the present application. For ease of reference, the <lb/>defendant in this case would be denoted, thereafter, as &quot;BCS&quot;. <lb/>29. BCS has, in its written submission (to which Mr. Subramanium <lb/>specifically alludes), provided a &quot;chart&quot;, &quot;to show coverage and prior <lb/>claiming of IN&apos;307 patent (species patent) in claim 22 of IN&apos;978 <lb/>patent&quot;, which constitutes Annexure 1 to this judgement. <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 168 of 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>30. A bare glance at said chart demonstrates, as has already been <lb/>noticed hereinabove, that BCS has &quot;cherry picked&quot; substituents, out of <lb/>the substitutions envisaged in the disclosure in Claim 22 of IN&apos;978, <lb/>for A, B, J, R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , R 4a , R 4b and R 5 . Even within the &quot;J&quot; <lb/>substituent, BCS has cherry-picked a &quot;suitable&quot; substituent for R 7 . No <lb/>justification for selecting the substituents in question is forthcoming in <lb/>the submissions advanced by BCS, except the intent of &quot;reaching&quot; <lb/>CTPR. Thus viewed, CTPR cannot be regarded as &quot;obvious&quot; from, or <lb/>&quot;taught by&quot; IN&apos;978. <lb/>31. BCS has also sought to discredit the affidavit of Mr. Lahm. <lb/>The plaintiff relied on the said affidavit both for the submission that <lb/>proceeding from IN&apos;978 to Claim 1 in IN&apos;307 involved &quot;inventive <lb/>steps&quot; as well as for the submission that CTPR possessed additional <lb/>efficacy, over the compounds claimed in IN&apos;978. The written <lb/>submissions of BCS, even while acknowledging the contents of the <lb/>affidavit of Mr. Lahm regarding the inventive steps involved in <lb/>synthesising CTPR from the Markush moiety forming subject matter <lb/>of Claim 22 in IN&apos;978, contains no submissions on the basis of which <lb/>the assertions of the affidavit of Mr Lahm could be discredited. In <lb/>this regard, the written submission of BCS merely states thus: <lb/>&quot;Plaint and declaration of Plaintiff&apos;s expert Mr. George Lahm <lb/>claims that novelty an inventive step resides in the following <lb/>part of the Markush structure of Formula 1 of claim 1 of <lb/>IN&apos;307 patent: <lb/>&quot; <lb/></body>

			<body>Having thus noted the observations of Mr. Lahm regarding the <lb/>inventive steps involved in arriving at Claim 1 of IN&apos;307, BCS does <lb/>not furnish any reason or justification for rejecting the affidavit of Mr. <lb/>Lahm on this aspect. The reservations, expressed by BCS to the <lb/>affidavit of Mr. Lahm, are restricted to the issue of additional efficacy <lb/>of CTPR over the subject matter of IN&apos;978. Presumably, therefore, <lb/>BCS acknowledges the existence of inventive steps, in proceeding <lb/>from Claim 22 in IN&apos;978 to Claim 1 in IN&apos;307. Even otherwise, I <lb/>have, by comparing the two claims, found, on facts, that such <lb/>inventive steps do, prima facie, exist. <lb/>32. When this application was heard in part, BCS sought to <lb/>introduce an affidavit of Mr Ajit Singh Gujral, who, in turn, sought to <lb/>discredit the declaration of Mr. Lahm. I have already noted, <lb/>hereinabove, that the evidence of the inventor of the invention has <lb/>been accorded additional credibility, even by the Supreme Court. Any <lb/>further examination of the comparative declarations of Mr. Lahm and <lb/>affidavit of Mr. Gujral has, necessarily, to await trial. At this stage, in <lb/>the face of the declaration of Mr. Lahm, I am unwilling to treat the <lb/></body>

			<body>affidavit of Mr. Gujral, filed belatedly and in the midst of hearing, as <lb/>rendering the suit patent vulnerable. <lb/>33. The written submission of BCS further contends that <lb/>&quot;Plaintiffs&apos; alleged inventive step ... wherein chemical structure has <lb/>N -(2 -pyridinyl)-substituted pyrazole which disubstitution on the <lb/>anthranilamide phenyl ring is also claimed on disclosed in compounds <lb/>of Plaintiffs&apos; own earlier document WO&apos;978 and in particular, <lb/>WO&apos;115.&quot; This, it is stated, stands explained in paras 58 to 75 of the <lb/>reply, filed by BCS, to IA 2084/2021. Presumably, by this averment, <lb/>BCS is seeking to assert vulnerability, of Claim 1 in IN&apos;307 on the <lb/>ground of &quot;anticipation by prior publication&quot;. <lb/>34. I have already noted, earlier in this order, that &quot;anticipation by <lb/>prior publication&quot; can be alleged only where the claim of the specie <lb/>patent is expressly published in the alleged genus patent. BCS has <lb/>alleged &quot;disclosure&quot; of CTPR in WO&apos;115. The parameters of the <lb/>concept of &quot;disclosure&quot; have already been examined and explained <lb/>hereinabove. Within the said parameters, I am unable to convince <lb/>myself that the averments contained in paras 58 to 75 of the reply <lb/>filed by BCS to the present application, indicate disclosure of CTPR, <lb/>or of Claim 1 in IN&apos;307, in WO&apos;115. <lb/>35. What is claimed, in WO&apos;115, and which, according to BCS, <lb/>&quot;discloses compounds of Formula I&quot;, is the following: <lb/></body>

			<page>Page 171 of 174 <lb/></page>

			<body>36. BCS asserts, in its reply to the present application, that <lb/>&quot;Cyclicized version of CTPR is derived from Markush structure of <lb/>claim 1 of WO&apos;115 when the following substitutions are made&quot;. <lb/>Thereafter, the reply proceeds to cherry-pick substituents, out of the <lb/>suggested substituents in Claim 1 of WO&apos;115. Even after such <lb/>cherry-picking, BCS arrives, not at CTPR, but, allegedly, at &quot;a <lb/>derivative of Chlorantraniliprole/CTPR in which the ring closure has <lb/>been done in the other direction&quot;. Thereafter, the reply proceeds to set <lb/>out, in detail, &quot;the generic strategy of ring closure&quot;, resulting in <lb/>synthesis of an &quot;open ring compound&quot;. It is not the contention of the <lb/>BCS, in the reply, that this &quot;open ring compound&quot; is CTPR. Reliance <lb/>has also been placed, in the reply, to the declaration, in WO&apos;115 that <lb/>&quot;by the procedures described herein together with methods known in <lb/>the art, the following compounds of Tables 1 to 33 can be prepared&quot;. <lb/>Proceeding therefrom, the reply asserts that &quot;Example 2 in Pages 41-<lb/>43 of WO&apos;115 discloses the preparation of one of the structurally <lb/>closest molecules, i.e., 6 -chloro -2 -[-1 -(3 -chloro -2 -<lb/>pyridinyll) -3 -(trifluoromethyl) -1H -pyroazol -5 -yl] -3,S -<lb/>dimethyl -4 (3H) -quinazoline&quot;. <lb/></body>

			<body>37. All these submissions, even seen in conjunction, do not make <lb/>out a case of disclosure of CTPR in WO&apos;115. This, in fact, has been <lb/>acknowledged, albeit by a side wind, in para 71 of the reply, of BCS, <lb/>to the present application, which reads thus: <lb/>&quot;Thus, in view of the above, WO&apos;115/US&apos;614 invariably and <lb/>unequivocally anticipates Chlorantraniliprole as well as its <lb/>precursor -the Benzoxazinone key intermediate, claimed in <lb/>IN&apos;307 patent.&quot; <lb/>38. It is not necessary, at this interlocutory stage, to analyse, <lb/>further, the involved process by which, by effecting select <lb/>substitutions on the claims in WO&apos;115, BCS asserts that it has arrived <lb/>at &quot;key intermediates&quot; for CTPR. One may just reproduce, in this <lb/>regard, the diagrammatic representation of the manner in which such <lb/>&quot;disclosure&quot; is alleged, by BCS, to have taken place in WO&apos;115, as <lb/>contained in the written submissions filed by BCS, thus: <lb/></body>

			<body>39. Thus, even on a comprehensive reading of the said assertions in <lb/>the pleadings of BCS, it is not possible to hold that CTPR was <lb/>disclosed in WO&apos;115, or that its validity has been rendered vulnerable <lb/>as a result thereof. <lb/>40. Other submissions, advanced by BCS, have already been dealt <lb/>with hereinabove. BCS has sought to contend that denial of <lb/>injunction to the plaintiff would not result in irreparable loss to it, as it <lb/>could be compensated in damages and that public interest is in favour <lb/>of denial of injunction, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. <lb/>These are, obviously, merely &quot;residuary&quot; submissions. Without citing <lb/>judicial authorities in this regard, it is well settled that, in intellectual <lb/>property infringement cases, especially in patent infringement claims <lb/>and, most specifically, where the infringement case of a <lb/>pharmaceutical/agrochemical patent, public interest dictates injuncting <lb/>perpetuation of an invention which is, prima facie, infringing in <lb/>nature. Damages, it is well settled, are no panacea in such a case. <lb/>41. BCS does not dispute the fact that it seeks to exploit the claim <lb/>in IN&apos;307. As with the defendant in CS (Comm) 611/2019, BCS, too, <lb/>seeks to assail the validity of IN&apos;307 as a ground to justify such <lb/>exploitation. For the reasons cited hereinabove, no prima facie case <lb/>can be said to exist, in the said challenge. The inexorable sequitur is <lb/>that the proposed exploitation deserves to be injuncted. <lb/></body>

			<body>42. For this reason, IA 2084/2021 also succeeds and is allowed, in <lb/>terms of the directions issued, hereinabove, in IA 15352/2019 in CS <lb/>(Comm) 611/2019 which apply, mutatis mutandis, to the present <lb/>application as well. <lb/>43. As the Court is presently functioning on a virtual mode, and it <lb/>is not possible to furnish a physical copy of this judgement to the <lb/>parties, the judgement would take effect from the time of its uploading <lb/>on the website of this Court or from the time it is emailed to learned <lb/>Counsel for the parties, whichever is earlier. The Registry is directed <lb/>to email a copy of this judgement to learned Counsel for the parties as <lb/>expeditiously as possible. <lb/>C. HARI SHANKAR, J <lb/>July 7, 2021 <lb/>ANNEXURE -I <lb/></body>
